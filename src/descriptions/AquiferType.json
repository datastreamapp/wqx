  "CONFINED": "A confined (artesian) aquifer is an aquifer bounded both at the bottom and at the top by an impermeable stratum (aquiclude) and fully filled with water which is usually under (artesian) pressure. When perforating a hole into the ground until reaching the confined aquifer, one will see the water level in the hole rise to above the top of the aquifer and perhaps even above the land surface.",
  "SEMI-CONFINED": "A semi-confined aquifer is an aquifer underlain by an impermeable stratum and bounded at the top by soil layers of relatively low permeability (hydraulic conductivity), especially in horizontal sense. These layers form the semi-confining layer (the aquitard) in which a free water table is found. The flow of water in the top layer is mainly vertical while the horizontal flow is negligible. Semi-confined aquifers are often found in river delta's and coastal plains.",
  "UNCONFINED": "An unconfined (free, phreatic) aquifer is an aquifer underlain by an impermeable stratum, but the top of the the aquifer consists of soil layers that are permeable enough to provide easy passage of water, at least in vertical sense. Such an aquifer has a free water table or phreatic surface. When perforating a hole into the ground until it fills with water, and letting the water rest, the water level in the hole can be observed and it indicates the level of the water table in the aquifer outside the hole."
