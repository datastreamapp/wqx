  "ALPO_MI": "Nine 20-second D-frame kick net (250 µm mesh) samples were taken on January 12, 2005 from 100 m (328 ft) reaches centered on water quality sampling locations.  D-frame kick nets are the recommended sampling gear for RBP multihabitat bioassessments (Barbour et al. 1999) because they typically collect 95 % of the MI taxa present in a stream and can be used in pools, riffles, and runs (Frost et al. 1970).  Samples were pooled then preserved in 70% ethyl alcohol.  Biomonitoring programs often use subsampling to provide a ?consistent unit of effort? and to reduce the amount of time, effort, and ultimately cost, necessary for characterizing MI communities; however, all organisms were identified during this study because the primary intent was to inventory as many taxa as possible within the park streams.  MI were identified in the laboratory to the lowest practical taxonomic level (usually genus) using standard keys (Peckarsky et al. 1990; Merritt and Cummins 1996) and counted under 60X ? magnification.  At least one individual from every taxon was digitally photographed under magnification as a voucher.",
  "APHN_EWI": "Samples are collected by lowering and raising a sampler through the water column at the center of each increment (this sampling location is referred to as the vertical).

Temperature measurements in °C were collected using either Universal Enterprises Inc., and/or Taylor Bi-Therm dial thermometers. Salinity concentrations were determined using an Atago S-10 salinity refractometer which was calibrated at 0 ppt with distilled water before sampling.  Weather conditions were noted in the field and checked off on the data sheet as either sunny, cloudy, overcast, raining, windy or calm.  Rainfall amounts were determined using a rain gauge located at Assateague Island National Seashore headquarters.  Tide stage data was determined from Sandy Hook, NJ tide information and calculated for the Ocean City Inlet, in Maryland, and Tom's Cove in Virginia.  Rain and tide data was entered later onto the field data sheets.",

  "BELA_LAVSE": "Sediment samples were collected for the Lava Lake project (USACE et al. 1990) at surface water sample locations so that both sediment and surface water quality could be assessed. The sediment sample was collected after to water sample to minimize turbidity during water collection. Sediment samples were collected from marshes, poorly-drained areas, and wetlands. Samples were collected from depths of 12 to 18 inches using a shovel. Samples were either transferred from the shovel to a stainless steel bowl and then into sample jars, or directly into the sample jar. Stainless steel spoons were used to fill the sample jars. The procedure was done with minimal mixing of the sediment in order to minimize volatilization of potential contaminants. Individual sample containers were marked with the collection date, time, sample number, and required analysis on the day of collection. Each container lid was sealed with glass filament tape, placed in a resealable bag, and packed with other samples in insulated coolers. Strict chain-of-custody records were maintained, and samples were stored overnight in a locked room for shipment the next day. Samples collected at Lava Lake had to be transported to Nome before shipment to Anchorage and beyond. This increased transport time by at least one day from the time of sample collection. Samples were shipped via Alaska Airlines air cargo service to Anchorage then via a second-day delivery service to ARDL, Inc, in Mt. Vernon, Illinois for analyses.

Temperature, specific conductance and pH were measured in the field in conjunction with surface water sampling at Lava Lake. Surface water samples were collected from marshes, poorly-drained areas, and wetlands. Samples were collected from nearshore areas using the sample containers which were lowered into the water by hand. Care was taken to minimize worker contact with the surface water prior to and during sample collection. Water samples for volatile organic and total petroleum hydrocarbon analyses were not preserved as required by the work plan because a supplier failed to deliver an order to Nome. Efforts to obtain hydrochloric and nitric acids for this purpose from a local source were unsuccessful. Water samples from this study were preserved with nitric acid (HNO3) for metals analyses only.

  "CABR_BWTFC": "The steps for Surfrider Foundation - Blue Water Task Force's collection of coastal water samples for bacterial analyses are as follows. Step 1: Before approaching each site to take the sample, fill out the site log sheet. Use site location names from the master list. It is very important for record keeping that we all use the same names for record keeping purposes. Use your best judgment for Temperature (water and air), Depth, Wave height, Weather conditions, and whether it has rained in the last three days. Step 2: Mark the Whirl-Pak® or sample bottle with the site location name, and the date and time the sample is taken. Also include your contact information. Be as detailed as you can when describing location... especially if there was a storm drain nearby: how far upstream or downstream was it? Try to collect the sample as close to the drop off time (3:00-6:00pm every Sunday) as possible as the results will be most accurate. (Samples are only good for 4-6 hours after collected). Step 3: Gather a sample from a specific site using a sterile Whirl-Pak® sample bag or the sterile sample bottle. Open container just before taking sample to prevent contamination. Take the sample approximately six inches below the surface of the water in ankle to knee deep water from an area where waves are breaking or water is agitated. Note: After mid-April 2002, this was changed to: collect sample in 1-2 feet of water. Take the sample during an incoming surge of water. Collect the sample as a wave is passing and away from your body. Collect the sample as much as possible below the surface of the water. Try to avoid getting sediments in the sample as much as possible and try to avoid taking the sample from an area where the water is not moving. Step 4: Do not fill to the top. An air space should be left to allow the contents to be shaken in the lab. Step 5: Close the sample tightly and immediately place the sample in a cooler with blue ice to keep sample cold. Step 6: The sample must be kept cool (in the cooler or refrigerated) and must be inoculated within six hours from the time it is collected. Step 7: Turn samples in at the lab. Remember to pick-up clean sample bottles or Whirl-Paks® at the lab for next week.",
  "CABR_FFSNT": "Water was collected by the Friends of Famosa Slough (FFS) twice a month for the analyses of the nutrients of nitrate, nitrite, orthophosphate, and turbidity. The best time for collection was at dawn, 2 hours after an ocean high tide exceeding 4 feet. At each of the five sites, sampling began by filling nearly full a plastic collection bottle. The bottles were numbered on their sides and cap to correspond to the site sampled. Water was drawn from below the surface level and with care not to agitate bottom sediment or to collect algae (if possible). The bottles were returned to the lab immediately for the analyses to be completed within 4 hours.",
  "CABR_IZCPS": "Database software does not allow Field Msr/Obs for this biological format, and requires a Sample Collection Procedure and Gear. In truth, this is a Field Survey where taxonomic counts were determined on site without disturbing the organisms or habitat. The sampling method used is circular plots (size frequency measurements), and is repeated in the three zones, with 6 circular plots (3 on the cliffs and 3 on the boulders). Due to some individual situations (replacing plots that have broken off, adding plots to track recovery of disturbance) there can be different numbers of plots in some zones. Monitoring occurs twice per year, in the spring (February-April) and fall (October-December); ideally, sampling should occur in March and November. A season of activities usually takes 2-4 sampling days, depending on the number and experience of volunteers, the weather and tide conditions, and if there are any unforeseen equipment failures. Monitoring is scheduled on the lowest possible tides with at least one day with a -1.0 tide. Depending on the number of volunteers, the ideal numbers of people in teams are at least 2 for plot finding, 2 measurers, and 1 recorder for the circular plots. Circular plots are marked with a single central bolt. On every sampling day, park staff completed a field log of environmental data. To collect abundance and size-frequency data, all Lottia gigantea (giant owl limpets) in a 1 m radius circle of a single central bolt were measured. Attach a 1 m length of line (or a precut measuring tape) to the bolt, and swinging the line around the bolt while carefully searching the area for limpets. Check under all cracks and crevices, between mussels and other organisms, and under patches of algae, as limpets can be quite cryptic and fouled with other organisms. A small flashlight is helpful. All owl limpets that are touched with the tape, regardless of the bumps and dips between the bolt and the limpet, are considered inside the circle. This includes those underneath ridges. Measure limpets to the nearest 1 mm with metal calipers, call out the measurement to a recorder, and mark the limpet with forestry crayon to avoid double measurement. Limpets smaller than 15 mm should not be measured and recorded because they are difficult to identify correctly. Be sure to check the calipers carefully?the zero mark can be located in different places leading to different ways of reading them. If a limpet is hard to measure because of its location (i.e. deep in a crevice), estimate its size using the back or end of the calipers; never remove a limpet from the rock. If there is more than one measurer, use two different colors of crayon to check each other?s work. Each recorder should start on opposite ends of the plot and work on separate semicircles and then switch to check each other. As the measurers call out numbers, the recorder should repeat back the numbers and then make a tick mark on the logsheet next to the size (cross after every five tick marks). At the end of the plot, the recorder should tally up the number of limpets in each size class (e.g. to avoid confusion, write and circle 2 next to two tick marks, which could be confused for 11) as well as the total number of limpets in the plot. It is often more comfortable for both measurers and recorders to use foam gardening pads to sit and lean on while working on circular plots. All measurers must receive some training on limpet identification prior to measuring limpets, and at least one member of each team is highly experienced in identification. All data were collected on paper datasheets. Since 1998, new datasheets have been developed in order to ease record-keeping in the field. Earlier datasheets can be found on file at the Park. Despite the format changes, the information recorded on the different datasheet versions has remained consistent over the study period.",
  "CABR_IZTS": "Database software does not allow Field Msr/Obs for this biological format, and requires a Sample Collection Procedure and Gear. In truth, this is a Field Survey where taxonomic counts were determined on site without disturbing the organisms or habitat. Species that are rare or potentially absent from Cabrillo National Monument intertidal zones are difficult to sample with transects of a reasonable, workable size. For these species, sampling effort is standardized by time rather than space. Timed searches and censuses are conducted separately in each zone, and these techniques do not require the establishment of permanent plots. Timed searches were conducted to target black abalone (Haliotis cracherodii) and ochre sea stars (Pisaster ochraceus), although other sea star and abalone species were always counted when encountered. Sampling was conducted twice per year by a team of park staff and volunteers. In each zone, one person spent 30 minutes looking for abalone and sea stars in habitat that is commonly inhabited by those animals. The standard of effort is 30 person-minutes in each zone, and occasionally 2 people would look for 15 minutes each. This provides time-standardized presence/absence data. The entire zone could be considered an irregular plot and the search effort is limited by time. The searcher should bring copies of the site maps with them to circle the approximate area searched. This will provide some rough information about search area. Although these timed searches are designed to target black abalone and ochre sea stars, all species of abalone and sea stars are recorded when encountered. Urchin observations are always noted as well. Other species of interest can be noted when found, although not at the expense of looking for abalone and sea stars. The search should be done close to low tide by someone with familiarity with the species and their habits. The searcher should focus on abalone and sea star habitat and be prepared to get a little wet. Wander throughout the lower intertidal, looking under ledges, rocks, and at the bases of boulders. Use a small waterproof flashlight to aid the search. Measure and record any species listed on the log sheet. Measure the maximum shell length of abalone. For sea stars, measure from the end of the longest leg to the center of the disk. For urchins, measure the diameter of the test (the body underneath the spines). It is acceptable to estimate the size of urchins, especially if many are found or if they are deep in crevices. Do not spend a lot of time measuring urchins. Record the habitat and other observations about the species. Other species found can be noted on the sheet, but the focus of the search should be abalone and sea stars. At the end of the search, place zeros next to all species that were searched for but not found. The approximate area searched should be circled on a copy of the site map. This site map can be included with the log sheet hardcopies.",

All samples were sieved aboard ship through a 1.0 mm mesh stainless steel screen with a surface area of 1600 cm2. Care is taken to avoid damaging animals on the screen surface when washing the sample and when transferring the retained organisms to the sample container. After sieving is completed, all remaining material is transferred to plastic containers for relaxation prior to fixation. Samples are relaxed in magnesium sulfate and seawater. Containers are filled no more than one-half full with material, topped with MgSO4 solution, inverted several times to distribute the relaxant, and are stored in a cooler or covered with a damp towel for approximately 30 minutes. After 30 minutes, buffered formaldehyde, (37% formaldehyde saturated with sodium borate), is added to the sample to achieve about a 15% formalin solution for fixation. A volume reference placard is included along with other field supplies to assist the field marine biologist in adding the appropriate amount of fixative.

  "CRLA_DSCS": "Three samples were taken at a station visit by inserting a McNeil corer into the sediment to a depth of approximately 10 cm and removing all detrital material. The larger detritus was removed initially by hand, and then a known volume of water was pumped from the corer. Pumping continued until the water became clear or until 10 liters of water had been removed. The water was immediately sieved through a 250 um Tyler sieve, and a 200 ml subsample of the water that passed through the sieve was collected. The material greater than 250 um and the subsample were held on ice and taken to laboratories at Oregon State University within 48 hours.",

  "CRLA_DWDVS": "Moss samples collected during deep-water dives were removed from the substrate by controlling two manipulators mounted on the front of the submersible. A metal furniture clamp with a short piece of rope at one end was held open by a manipulator and subsequently dropped into the moss bed. The clamp with the trapped sample of moss was retrieved by the manipulator and transferred to a wire basket located in front of the submersible. During the geological dives, rock samples with attached moss also were collected with the manipulators. After each dive, the samples were sorted, refrigerated and returned to the laboratory for examination.",

The sampling process involved lowering the net vertically to the desired depth. Then, more cable was slowly released to maintain the net at depth as the forward motion of the boat brought the angle of the towing cable to 60 degrees. The cable length at 60 degrees is twice the vertical depth. The sampling equipment employed did not have a closing apparatus, attempts were made to estimate the extent of contamination of the samples by zooplankton encountered while towing back through depths above 125 meters. All samples were immediately preserved in 3 percent formalin solution.",

The samplers did not have flow meters, and the samplers were towed for exactly 10 minutes in order to standardize the volume of water sampled. An exception was the first series of tows collected on July 24, 1968, which were towed for 15 minutes. During sampling four samplers were simultaneously towed horizontally at 12.5 meter depth intervals from 25 to 62.5 meters and 75 to 125 meters, omitting a sample from 112.5 meters. Two samplers were simultaneously towed at 1 and 12.5 meters. A cable angle of 70 degrees was maintained after a sufficient cable length was attained to reach the desired depth. The sampling equipment employed did not have a closing apparatus, attempts were made to estimate the extent of contamination of the samples by zooplankton encountered while towing back through depths above 125 meters. Immediately after sampling the vertical distribution on August 25, 1967, two vertical tows using the No. 6 mesh standard tow net were made from 125 meters to the surface to estimate the contamination from depths above 125 meters.

It was kept between the surface and the pond's bottom for each tow. No attempt was made to keep the net at the pond's surface or bottom. All ponds sampled for zooplankton were wide enough and deep enough to accomplish this type of tow. Samples rinsed from the net were preserved with formalin and placed in plastic sample bottles. Zooplankton samples (ca. 50 mL) were preserved in the field with a 10%/vol. formalin solution to a 4% final concentration in the sample.",

  "CRLA_WSFS": "Samples of water surfaces impacted by fuel residues and with natural slicks were acquired using 20 x 26 cm pre-cleaned quartz fiber filter sheets (annealed at 350 degrees Celsius for a minimum of 4 hours). Each filter was used to blot the surface film six times by alternating sides during collection. This assumes that the area blotted (0.31 m2/filter) adsorbed the surface slick or surface microlayer, typically 100 um thickness, uniformly from that area. Sample filters were then placed in pre-heated (< 350 degrees Celsius) ??Qorpak?? wide-mouth jars (with teflon lined caps), spiked with approximately 15 ml of a chloroform/methanol (2:1) solvent mixture to stop microbial alteration and degradation, then stored at 4 degrees Celsius for transport to Oregon State University (OSU) and the Geochemical and Environmental Research Group Lab at Texas A&M University (GERG).",

These procedures have been slightly modified from protocols developed for the USGS National Water-Quality Assessment Program (Moulton et al., 2002). The primary difference between this SOP and USGS methods is that ERMN uses ethanol, instead of formalin, as a preservative because it poses lower human and environmental health risk. Otherwise, this SOP is a streamlined version of the USGS approach - methods (e.g., fine sediment sampling) that are described in the USGS protocol that are not used by ERMN are not included in this document.

In the laboratory, all grab samples were rinsed gently through a 0.5 mm mesh sieve to remove preservatives and sediment, stained with Rose Bengal, and stored in 70% isopropanol solution until processing. Subsequently, the organisms were carefully removed with forceps and placed in labeled plastic vials containing 70% isopropanol.",
  "FIIS_ACCS": "A local commercial clamming vessel (F/V Ocean Girl) was subcontracted to conduct the surf clam survey. The F/V Ocean Girl is an 80-foot stern-rigged commercial surf clam and ocean quahog fishing vessel owned and operated by Winter Harbor Brands, Inc. The clamming vessel?s dredge was outfitted with modified gear to retain sub-legal clams. The modified gear consisted of lining the vessel?s 90-inch clam dredge with 1inch by 3-inch wire mesh. The small mesh size enabled the dredge to retain sub-legal clams. Culling rollers were also kept close together to facilitate the sorting of the sub-legal clams. A surf clam must be at least four (4) inches in length to be retained for sale, or 102 mm. A sub-legal clam is any clam shorter than 4 inches, or 102 mm. The blade of the dredge was set at a depth of 4.5 inches. Hose length and tow warp was 140 feet and 130 feet, respectively. Water pressure was set at 80 psi. Documentation of each tow position was recorded using the vessel?s on-board navigation system (LORAN C). The vessel located each sampling station within the borrow areas using its on-board navigation system. Once the vessel was on station, the captain dropped the dredge for a three minute tow at a speed of 1.5 knots. At the end of the three minutes, the dredge was hauled back. The contents of the dredge were tripped into a hopper. Two on board biologists, assisted by the two-man deck crew, sorted the contents of the dredge. Hydraulically driven belts conveyed the contents of the dredge. Trash and non-target animals were removed from the catch.",
  "FIIS_ACEBC": "A total of three samples were collected at each transect. Sample No. 1 was collected in the high tide wrackline; No. 2 was collected at the approximate mid-tide line; and No. 3 was collected in the sub-tidal surf zone. Each sample was collected utilizing a three inch diameter aluminum tube which was inserted eight inches into the sediment. The core was removed from the substrate and transferred to a plastic wash tub. All samples were sieved through a 0.5 millimeter stainless steel sieve until most of the fine material was removed from the sample. The contents of the sieve were transferred to a wide mouth one liter sample which contained both an external and internal label identifying the sample. The samples were then preserved in a 10 percent buffered formaldehyde solution.",

  "FIIS_SMEGS": "At each station, subtidal fish and decapods, eelgrass, and macroalgae were sampled simultaneously. After each replicate throw trap was emptied, eelgrass was sampled from immediately outside the throw trap using 23 cm x 23 cm benthic box corer. Above and below-ground grass samples were removed, transferred to a sieve (1 mm mesh), rinsed of all sediment, placed in bags and put on ice. In the laboratory, grass and macroalgae samples were refrigerated.",
  "FIIS_SMFDS": "At each station, subtidal fish and decapods, eelgrass, and macroalgae were sampled simultaneously. Replicate samples (three in June, five in all subsequent months) of nekton and macroalgae were obtained using a 1 m2 x 0.75 m high throw trap. All throw trap samples were from eelgrass beds adjacent to beach and marsh shorelines. The trap frame was constructed from thin aluminum bars, with 6 mm diameter wire mesh surrounding the four sides. The top and bottom of the trap were left open. Samples were taken by carrying the trap to a grassbed, standing quietly for a few moments, and then throwing the trap and quickly pushing it into the sediment. All nekton and macroalgae were removed using a 1 m by 0.5 m dip net with 1 mm mesh. The trap was considered empty after three successive scoops produced no new specimens. Macroalgae was placed into bags and returned to the laboratory. Most nekton were identified, measured and released in the field, although larger samples of decapods were preserved and returned to the laboratory. After each replicate trap was emptied, eelgrass was sampled from immediately outside the trap using 23 cm x 23 cm benthic box corer. Above and below-ground grass samples were removed, transferred to a sieve (1 mm mesh), rinsed of all sediment, placed in bags and put on ice. In the laboratory, grass and macroalgae samples were refrigerated.",
  "FIIS_SZFDS": "Shore zone fish and decapods were sampled using replicated quarter circle beach seines. In May and June, two replicates were taken. This was increased to three replicates for all subsequent trips. For each sample, a small seine (10 m x 1m high with 6 mm mesh and a center bag) was stretched perpendicular to the shoreline until fully extended and then swept in an arc towards the shore. Both ends were then simultaneously pulled in to the shore, capturing nekton in the center bag. Area covered by each seine haul approximated 75m2. At beach stations, seine samples were collected directly from the beach. At marsh stations, seine samples were collected from the marsh bank, not far from the marsh surface. All seine samples were collected from the unvegetated band separating the shoreline and eelgrass beds. Seine samples were never collected from eelgrass beds at any station. All samples were taken before high tide, thus preventing animals access to salt marsh surfaces.  When possible, fish specimens were identified, counted, measured for total length (mm) and released back to the field. For shrimp and crabs, carapace length and width were measured, respectively. All others were preserved in a 10% formalin solution and returned to the laboratory for examination.",
  "FIIS_XWCC": "Seawater samples were collected at discrete depths using 1.7 l Niskin bottles and a specially designed 2.5 liter GO-FLO Niskin bottle fired at the bottom, mounted on a rosette multi-sampling device. These bottles, made of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), are metal free. After recovery of the rosette, the sampling bottles were taken to a constant temperature laboratory van equipped with special air filtration units. Immediately after drawing dissolved oxygen samples, the trace metal samples were collected by pressurizing the sampling bottle with nitrogen gas and attaching an acid washed Millipore filter holder with a 0.45 um pre size Nuclepore filter to the stopcock of the bottle. After allowing approximately 100 ml of water to flow, in order to rinse the filter assembly, the filtered seawater was collected directly into a 125-ml acid cleaned, linear-polyethylene bottle. The filtered seawater was acidified with 100 ml of silica-redistilled, concentrated nitric acid and stored for later analysis at AOML in Miami. All the Nuclepore filters were ?pre-loaded? into the acid cleaned filter heads, on board ship, in an enclosed portion of the laboratory-van that was equipped with air filters and a positive air-flow system to minimize airborne particles. After use, the filter holders were rinsed with deionized distilled water (Millipore Super ?Q high-purity water, 18 megohm-centimeter resistivity level) and reloaded with new filters using plastic tweezers.",

For those sites with low flow and narrow, shallow channels (Coyote Creek, Nyhan Creek, Dragonfly Creek, Tennessee Hollow Creek, and Milagra Creek), 'grab' samples were collected mid-channel by dipping a 1-L baked, amber-glass bottle below the water surface. Samples from Lobos Creek, Rodeo Creek, Redwood Creek, and Sanchez Creek, which had higher flows and were wider and deeper, were collected as integrated samples (width and depth) using a Teflon bottle attached to a wading rod (Wilde and Radtke, 1998). Immediately after sampling, the water was transferred from the Teflon bottle into a 1-L baked amber-glass bottle. Water flow in Tennessee Hollow Creek was very low during the February and April sampling events, and as a result, water was collected using a small peristaltic pump, with Teflon tubing, to pump the water directly into a 1-L baked amber-glass bottle.

Major ion samples were filtered in-situ through a 0.45 um filter, using a hand-held peristaltic pump. Fitzgerald described the samples used for Uranium and Tritium analyses as grab samples. No additional information is given for the methods used to collect alkalinity and stable isotope samples, though it is likely grab samples were used for their analyses, also. Collection techniques for the well, stream, and rain stations were not described in the Fitzgerald paper.",
  "GRCA_GS_SP": "Water samples were collected from each spring at or as near as possible to the point of issuance from the water-bearing rock. Ground water discharge generally occurs along bedding planes or through fractures. Most water samples were collected from the area of greatest discharge. Where the point of issuance could not be accessed, water samples were collected at the first accessible location downstream from this point. Efforts were made to minimize contact of spring water with the atmosphere. Because different analytical methods required different sample treatments, each spring sample was collected into 10 distinct bottles for analysis. Samples were handled in a proper and consistent manner to minimize contamination. All bottles were pre-cleaned before sample teams entered Grand Canyon. The metals, anions, nutrients, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and oxygen-18 and hydrogen-2 (D or deuterium) bottles for each site were sequestered into a separate zippered plastic bag, which also contained two pairs of polypropylene gloves, a new 60-mL polystyrene syringe, and four Acrodisk 0.45-micron nominal pore-size Luer-Lock filters (contained in their own zippered plastic bag). Mercury bottles were pre-dosed with 2.5 mL of potassium dichromate/nitric acid and were sealed in their own individual Whirl-pak bags and kept separate from the rest of the sampling equipment and bottles. The remaining four bottles were kept together, but separate from all the other sample bottles. Because the large-volume radiochemistry, carbon-isotope, and strontium-isotope samples also required filtration, a hand-vacuum pump, a filtration manifold, and 0.45-micron polysulfone filters were also packed, but kept separate from the other sampling equipment. Field teams wore polypropylene gloves for all sample processing and collected samples in a certain order to minimize the potential for contamination. The non-isotope samples were collected and filtered first. A new syringe and Acrodisk filter were used, after field rinsing with spring water, to collect samples at each site. The anions bottle was filled first, followed by the nutrients, metals, and DOC bottles. Because the mercury bottle already contained preservative, it was filled last, after all other non-isotope sample bottles were filled, to minimize the possibility of cross-contaminating the other samples with the potassium dichromate preservative. A second or third Acrodisk filter was used for some non-isotope samples because the original filter became clogged. The oxygen-18 and deuterium sample was collected unfiltered and care was taken to eliminate head-space within the bottle. Tritium samples were also unfiltered. The radiochemistry, carbon-, and strontium-isotope samples were filtered using a filtration setup that consisted of a hand vacuum pump, which was connected to a polyethylene side-arm Erlenmeyer flask by plastic tubing. A magnetic filter holder on which was mounted a new 47-mm, 0.45-micron polysulfone filter was placed on the side-arm flask. The first 20 mL of the filtered sample was used to rinse the flask. Thereafter the sample was collected in the flask and distributed to either the radiochemistry bottle, the carbon-isotope bottle, or the strontium-isotope bottle. All samples were kept as cool as possible in the absence of ice; these samples were refrigerated as soon as possible after leaving the field, and analyzed as quickly as possible thereafter. The metals and radiochemistry samples were acidified as soon as possible after leaving the field?metals bottles with 1 mL of doubly distilled concentrated nitric acid and the radiochemistry bottles with 5 mL of concentrated hydrochloric acid. The remaining samples did not require any additional preservation procedures.",

Mercury bottles were pre-dosed with 2.5 mL of potassium dichromate/nitric acid and were sealed in their own individual Whirl-pak bags and kept separate from the rest of the sampling equipment and bottles. The remaining four bottles were kept together, but separate from all the other sample bottles. Because the large-volume radiochemistry, carbon-isotope, and strontium-isotope samples also required filtration, a hand-vacuum pump, a filtration manifold, and 0.45-micron polysulfone filters were also packed, but kept separate from the other sampling equipment. Field teams wore polypropylene gloves for all sample processing and collected samples in a certain order to minimize the potential for contamination. The non-isotope samples were collected and filtered first. The anions bottle was filled first, followed by the nutrients, metals, and DOC bottles. Because the mercury bottle already contained preservative, it was filled last, after all other non-isotope sample bottles were filled, to minimize the possibility of cross-contaminating the other samples with the potassium dichromate preservative. The oxygen-18 and deuterium sample was collected unfiltered and care was taken to eliminate head-space within the bottle. Tritium samples were also unfiltered. The radiochemistry, carbon-, and strontium-isotope samples were filtered using a filtration setup that consisted of a hand vacuum pump, which was connected to a polyethylene side-arm Erlenmeyer flask by plastic tubing. A magnetic filter holder on which was mounted a new 47-mm, 0.45-micron polysulfone filter was placed on the side-arm flask. The first 20 mL of the filtered sample was used to rinse the flask. Thereafter the sample was collected in the flask and distributed to either the radiochemistry bottle, the carbon-isotope bottle, or the strontium-isotope bottle. All samples were kept as cool as possible in the absence of ice; these samples were refrigerated as soon as possible after leaving the field, and analyzed as quickly as possible thereafter. The metals and radiochemistry samples were acidified as soon as possible after leaving the field?metals bottles with 1 mL of doubly distilled concentrated nitric acid and the radiochemistry bottles with 5 mL of concentrated hydrochloric acid. The remaining samples did not require any additional preservation procedures.",

After well development, the well casings were capped to ensure sample integrity. The well casings were permanently marked with the well number. Wells were purged three times the bore volume prior to sampling in order to remove stagnant water. Groundwater samples were collected using a peristaltic pump, dedicated tubing, and in-line filtering (0.45 um) apparatus. Samples were filtered and preserved, when appropriate, and collected in Nalgene plastic bottles. They were stored on ice in a cooler until transported to the laboratory for preparation and analysis.

  "GRKO_MACRO": "At each site, samples were obtained from the least embedded, most heterogeneous cobble substrates available. Once the site was selected, the Hess sampler was positioned for insertion into the substrate. Standing downstream of the site, and facing upstream, the sampler was grasped by the handles and held just above the water?s surface, with the collection net on the downstream side. To compensate for the effect of streamflow, the sampler was inserted just upstream of the desired location. The front of the sampler was elevated slightly and the sampler was driven into the water. When the bottom makes contact with the substrate, the bottom of the sampler was driven into the substrate using a series of quick, short, clockwise-counterclockwise rotations. The sampler was driven in as far as necessary to close any gaps between the substrate and the sampler bottom. If large cobbles or other objects prevent closure of the gap, these obstacles were removed by hand. If the gap could not be closed, preventing the loss of organisms, a new site was selected. Once the sampler was in place, the enclosed substrate was thoroughly churned and cleaned. Rocks and other debris were brushed or cleaned so that any attached organisms were removed, making sure all collectible organisms and debris were kept inside the sampler. Cleaning and brushing continued until all organisms have been removed from the substrate. Finally, using a series of clockwise and counter clockwise rotations, the remaining bottom material was thoroughly churned with a metal rod or screwdriver. The remaining bottom gravels and sands are scooped with the hands and dropped, allowing any remaining organisms to be flushed into the net. The contents of the collection bottle are emptied into a one quart (or smaller) sample jar. As many organisms as possible are removed from the collection net and collection jar as is practical (a few shall inevitably left behind) to preserve the integrity of the sample. A label was attached to the jar that clearly indentified the sample (location, date, replicate number, method of collection and preservation). A small piece of paper with station identification number or name, written in pencil, may also be put into the jar to conclusively identify the sample. Samples are preserved with ethanol (ETOH) and formalin. The final fixed sample should have a concentration of greater than 70% ETOH. Formalin is only used if it is absolutely necessary. Excess water is decanted from the jar using the lid to prevent loss of organisms.  The jar is then filled with ETOH. An ounce or two of formalin is added if the sample contains a large amount of organic material (algae, detritus, wastewater treatment plant effluent, etc.). The jar is closed securely.",

Extreme care was taken not to introduce contamination during augering. Auger heads were decontaminated after collection of each sample. A backhoe was used to excavate test pits at designated locations where access was possible. In most cases, caving of the alluvial gravel or refusal by gravel limited the backhoe and hand augers, respectively to 6 ft to 9 ft total depth. Field personnel collected samples from the 0 ft, 3 ft, 6 ft, and 9 ft depth or until refusal or native soils underlying the floodplain gravels were reached.

  "GRKO_SPWSC": "Lysimeters were installed to sample soil pore water. To install the lysimeters, a stainless steel hang auger was used to make a hole to the appropriate depth. Auger was decontaminated between sampling sites by rinsing and brushing with plastic scrub brush and tap water, then rinsed with Milli-Q water. Silica flour was mixed with Milli-Q water to create a slurry. Slurry was poured down the hole to make good contact between soil and lysimeter. A lysimeter was inserted into the hole, making sure the slurry was deep enough to cover the ceramic cup. After the slurry set, approximately 2 inches of 70-silica sand was added and bentonite was added to the surface. Before creating a vacuum, when setting the instrument, N2 gas was purged through the tubing and lysimeter to ensure water sample collected inside lysimeter will not be changed due to the presence of oxygen. Using a hand pump, a vacuum was created in the lysimeters by pumping to 50-60 centibars. Tubing ends are kept covered with cling wrap and rubber bands. Samples were filtered and preserved, when appropriate, and collected in Nalgene plastic bottles. They were stored on ice in a cooler until transported to the lab for preparation and analysis.

The inner Lagoon station was sampled in the same manner, except that the ten cores were taken in a circle approximately 3 m in diameter. The box corer, which samples an area of 1/64 of a square meter, was inserted into the substratum to a depth of 20-23 cm then inverted and removed with the core of sediment. After fixation in a weak formalin solution, the light and soft bodied organisms, which make up most of the species collected, were floated off by elutriation into a 0.5 mm sieve. This was done in such a manner as to use the same solution (by filtering through a 0.2 mm sieve) for all replicates, occasionally enriching with additional formalin. The remainder of the sample was filtered through a 1.0 mm sieve for removal of heavy bodied species such as bivalves and gastropods.

  "GWCA_NCHDE": "This collection method is based on Section 9060A and 9060B in: APHA, 2005. Standard Methods for the Study of Water and Wastewater, 21st Edition.  Guidelines are as follows: Plastic sample containers provided are sterile (specimen cups), so keep the container closed and inside the sealed plastic bag until the sample is to be collected. Sample location is important; avoid contact with banks and or stream beds so water fouling does not occur. To continue, caution should be exercised to avoid contamination of the inner surface of the cap and or container due to touching. To collect the water sample, hold the container at its base and plunge it downward in the water with the opening pointing down. Then turn the container slightly upward directed at the current. If there is no current then artificially create one by pointing the opening slightly upward and pushing the bottle horizontally in a direction away from the hand. Without delay after filling the container, pour off excess sample so meniscus sets directly at 100 milliliter mark and replace the cap immediately. This will leave ample air space of 2.5 centimeters for mixing. Store the sample at less than 10 degrees Celsius until analysis can be performed. This can be accomplished by incorporating coolers with freeze packs. For most accurate results analyze samples as soon as possible but do not exceed the 6-hour holding time.",

Samples were placed in decontaminated sample containers and coolers for delivery to the laboratory. Technicians used latex gloves that were changed after each individual sampling event to prevent cross contamination of samples.\n\nThe seven piezometers reached a depth of approximately eight feet below the ground surface. The ground water sampling process began by purging each piezometer prior to sampling with a decontaminated PVC bailer, or a gas powered pump and decontaminated tubing. The two manually installed wells (G-1, G-7) are shallower than the wells installed with an Earth Probe (G-2, G-3, G-4, G-5, G-6) and do not hold enough volume of water to permit use of the gas powered pump. Thus, G-1 and G-7 were purged with bailers. Purging with the pump and/or bailer proceeded until sediments at the bottom of the well were accumulating in the discharge of the pump or bailer. The wells were then allowed to recharge for approximately one hour before sampling began. Well sampling was initiated using PVC bailers on decontaminated fishing or nylon line. The bailers were lowered into the wells as many times as necessary to obtain approximately 200 milliliters. Then the sample water was transferred to containers and coolers for delivery to the analytical laboratory. \n\nGround water levels at G-4 were measured prior to purging. The readings were measured from the top of the well, approximately two feet above the ground surface, to the water surface.",

Water samples were collected using ultra-pure techniques in use by the USGS lab in Denver, CO. A disposable sterilized syringe with attached filters was used to collect water samples from cracks or other locations where water was issuing, as close to the source as possible. Sampling kits consisting of filtration equipment, pre-cleaned bottles, and labels were hermetically sealed in a plastic bag, and were prepared in the laboratory prior to a sampling trip. Each sampling kit was designated for use only once at a specific site. New kits were used at each subsequent site. The filtration equipment consisted of one 60-ml polystyrene syringe that had been nitric acid soaked in the laboratory prior to inclusion in the field kit. Eight disposable polysulfone membrane syringe filters with a nominal pore size of 0.45 micrometers were also included in the kit, along with several polyvinylchloride gloves to reduce handling contamination. Sample bottles included in the kit, were: one 60-ml baked glass bottle, one 30-ml deionized water soaked opaque brown polyethylene bottle, one deionized water soaked clear polyethylene bottle, and one 125-ml nitric acid-soaked polyethylene bottle with 1 ml concentrated ultra-pure nitric acid included in the bottle. In addition, one 125-ml nitric acid-soaked glass bottle with 5 ml of mixture of concentrated ultra-pure nitric acid and 1% w/v ultra-pure potassium dichromate included in the bottle was included in the kit. The samples were collected as follows: 1. The kit was unsealed and the polyvinylchloride (PVC) gloves were immediately placed on the hands of the person collecting the sample. 2. The 60-mL syringe was removed from its container and without a filter in place was filled with sample directly from the spring or seep. If it was not possible to fill the syringe from the back with the plunger removed, the syringe was filled by using the suction of the plunger to draw small volumes from shallow depressions near the source of the spring. This is a particularly important technique for sampling springs with small volumes of running water. 3. The initial filling of the syringe was discarded as a sample rinse prior to the filtration step. 4. A disposable filter was placed on the syringe (using the Luer-lock connector), and a small quantity of sample was forced through the filter to rinse it (approximately 10-mL). A portion of this rinse solution was transferred to the appropriate sample bottle for rinsing prior to filling with filtered sample. 5. After rinsing, the remainder of the sample in the syringe was filtered into the appropriate sample bottles. 6. The sample bottles were filled in the following order: 30-mL nutrient bottle, 60-mL anion bottle, 125-mL trace constituent bottle and finally, the 125-mL mercury bottle. Each bottle was thoroughly sealed before a subsequent bottle was opened. Nutrient samples were immediately chilled. 7. As the disposable filters became clogged, reducing the filtration rate, the old filter was discarded and replaced with a new filter. Each new filter was rinsed as described in step 4 above. 8. Dissolved organic carbon samples were chilled after processing.",

Water samples were collected either directly from the water body with a plunger and syringe or with a sample bottle that was later poured into a vacuum filtration unit. In both cases, a 0.45 micron membrane filter was used with the water sample.  The NURE database does not specify which of the two collection methods was used when activities generated field-filtered sample results.

Specific instructions for lake sites were not given. \nIf the plunger and syringe unit was used, LASL guidelines are as follows.  Before taking a sample, thoroughly rinse the syringe barrel and plunger in the water to be filtered so that any traces of previous sample water will be removed. After each use, remove the plunger from the syringe and rinse the barrel and plunger once with deionized water.  Fill the syringe by inserting it (without a filter holder) into the sample water, point first and with the plunger pushed down. When filling, hold the syringe at arm's length to avoid near-shore contamination. While the tip is submerged, pull out the plunger until a sufficient volume of water is sucked up into the barrel. Then insert the syringe tip into the tapered end of the filter holder until snug. Do not twist the filter holder when attaching it to the syringe because the tip is easily broken. Hold the sample container (or rabbit) vertically under the filter holder to catch the filtered water sample as the plunger is depressed.\nIf the vacuum filtration unit was used, LASL guidelines are as follows.  Rinse the large plastic beaker three times with the water to be sampled, then pour 100 ml of water into the top reservoir and filter it into the small glass beaker (using the hand vacuum pump).  If the filter paper becomes plugged, remove the beaker of filtered water, replace the filter, reassemble the unit, and resume filtering.

Then lift the sampler about a meter off the bottom and quickly release it to obtain the sample. The exact procedure can be modified to conserve time, but the water sample and water data must be collected in procedural sequence so that they are in hand before the sediment sampler has hit bottom and the water adjacent to the helicopter is contaminated by bottom sediment stirred up by the sampler. During this entire operation the pilot should keep the helicopter as stationary as possible.  The lake-sediment sampler weighs 11.8 kg (26 lb) and is a hollow, finned, pipelike device, 45 cm long, with a gravity-activated, one-way, floating ball valve that holds the sample core in the lower section.  Just before each use, rinse it quickly in the water of the lake to be sampled. It is driven into the lake-bottom sediment by gravity, facilitated by a conical band of lead around the outside of the sampler body. Retrieve the sampler by pulling on an attached tether until the top of the sampler is a few inches below the surface. At that point, the crew member taking the sample reaches below the water surface, grasps the apparatus about its middle, turns it to a horizontal position, and lifts it out of the water. If the apparatus is lifted out of the water without being horizontal, the sample may fall out of the lower core-retaining section.\nTo remove the sample from the core barrel, turn the sampler to a vertical position with its nose down, and shake it to move the one-way floating ball valve, thereby breaking the suction effect. The sample should then fall out of the core-retaining section and can be caught in a polyethylene sample bag appropriately labeled with both a prenumbered adhesive label (provided on the back of the data form) and by indelible marking pen. Samples should be of silt- and clay-sized sediment with ample organic material.  After communicating the required sample features to the person recording the data, close the sample bag by rolling and sealing it at the top and put it into a box either in or mounted on the outside of the helicopter. A small, hand-powered or motorized winch could be mounted in or on the helicopter for greater speed and efficiency in retrieving the sampler, but the provision and use of such a device are left entirely up to the contractor.",

West Coast sediment samples were obtained by Battelle Ocean Sciences using a specially constructed Kynar-coated Young-modified Van Veen bottom grab. The grab sampler was cleaned after each use and between each site. The sediment scoop was cleaned between each grab sample by washing with soap and water, rinsing with distilled water, rinsing with methanol or acetone, and rinsing with dichloromethane. Surface sediment skims taken from the top 1 cm of three separate grab samples were composited in the field to yield one sediment sample per station. Sediments were taken with a hand held scoop that was calibrated to take the top centimeter of sediment. The scoop was coated with Kynar [poly(vinylidene fluoride)] so that trace elements from the scoop did not contaminate the sediments being sampled. The order of operations followed were: Overlying water was drained from the grab using a Teflon siphoning tube so that the sediment surface was not disturbed. The top 1 cm of sediment was taken using the Kynar-coated sediment scoop. Sediment adjacent to the grab walls was avoided. Sediment samples were placed into separate station containers: 500-mL pre-cleaned Teflon jar for sediment chemistry, and Whirlpak bag for grain size. Samples were transferred to a cooler containing dry ice and returned to the laboratory at the end of each day. Station composites were represented by approximately equal weights of material from each of the three grabs.",
  "REDW_BELL": "Sampling in all visits consisted of attempting to remove all juvenile coho salmon from selected units by multiple passes with one or two backpack electroshockers (Smith Root Model 12). Sampling units were blocked with netting at the upstream and downstream ends and electroshocked to near depletion, with a minimum of 4 passes. Methodical electrofishing, and occasionally a direct observation diver, were used to insure removal of nearly all coho from each habitat unit. Depletion sampling was possible in Prairie Creek due to low winter base-flows. To reduce the impact of electrofishing, Gee wire mesh minnow traps were also used. Six traps were baited with rainbow trout eggs and fished for one hour each. Traps were re-set until no fish were captured, and then habitat units were electroshocked to remove any fish not captured in traps. All juvenile coho salmon captured were anesthetized with MS-222.",
  "REDW_BRWNS": "Block nets were placed at each end of a section to prevent emigration or immigration during sampling. A backpack mounted direct-current electroshocker (Model no. BP-2, Coffelt Electronics Co., Inc., Englewood, Colorado) was used to stun fish for capture. Fishing effort consisted of the time required to complete a sampling pass through a section. To maintain constant sampling effort, electroshocker voltage was not varied between passes and all passes were conducted in approximately the same elapsed time. Voltage settings ranged between 250 and 350 V depending on the site. Two or three passes were conducted in each section. A third pass was conducted if the second pass collected more than half the number of fish, of a given species, caught in the initial pass. The electroshocker was heavy, unwieldy, and difficult to transport in steep terrain or on multi-day trips to remote locations and therefore was not always suitable for use. The electroshocker was also most effective in relatively shallow water less than approximately one meter in depth. When the electroshocker was not available or appropriate, dip nets and direct observation were used.",

To sample redds, the collecting net was set approximately five feet below the downstream end of the redd. Substrate across the width of the redd was shoveled starting at the upstream end to a depth of approximately two feet. The substrate was slowly turned over down the length of the redd, maintaining a depth of two feet until the eggs were contacted.  Eggs were freed from the substrate with a minimum amount of pressure and resultant damage. When approximately one hundred eggs or larvae had floated into the net, the net was removed and the specimens were counted. The numbers of live and dead individuals were recorded and the live specimens were places back in the gravel and covered over.",

Streambed material was removed around the margin of the trap frame to a depth of approximately 20-35 cm for the net apron. The apron was secured with gravel/cobbles to prevent lateral migration of fry beyond the trap perimeter. Traps were inspected and maintained every two days until emergence occurred, then monitored daily. All captured fry were anesthetized with Tricane methansulfonate (MS-222) to facilitate handling.

  "REDW_EGST": "An E.G. Solutions (5 foot diameter cone) rotary screw trap was positioned in the main current of the stream alongside a bedrock outcropping on the left side of the river (looking downstream). The trap operated continually (24hrs/day, 7 days a week) from April 4th through August 5th, except for relatively infrequent periods of high flow. During the two periods of high flow that caused the cone of the trap to spin too fast (e.g. > 28 revolutions/3 minutes), the trap cone was raised to stop trapping, or the trap was re-positioned into slower currents to continue trapping. When flows decreased, the trap was placed back into the original main current location. Weir panels and rock weirs were installed upstream of the trap to funnel water and fish into the area of the cone. During the latter part of the season, plastic drop cloths were used to line the weirs to further increase flow and catches. Efforts were continually made to maximize trap catches, and minimize trap mortalities with respect to high flows and debris amounts. Moderate to high flows and/or wind can cause substantial amounts of debris collection that can increase mortality of trapped fish. When trapping under higher flows, the livebox was checked every 1-2 hours dependent upon the amount of debris in the livebox. During normal flow, the livebox was emptied of debris every afternoon or night prior to the next morning?s catch. The livebox was emptied at 08:00 every morning by 2-3 technicians. All fish were graded by size and placed in 5 gallon buckets for delivery to 32 gallon perforated plastic holding cans located on the margin of the river. Young of year (0+) juveniles were separated from 1+ (between 1 and 2 years old) and 2+ (between 2 and 3 years old) juveniles to decrease predation of 0+ fish in the 5 g buckets and holding cans. 1+ and 2+ fish were kept together. Two holding cans were used to hold the contents of the livebox, and random samples of each species were then netted from the holding cans and transported to the streamside station in 5 g buckets for enumeration and biometric data collection. During the months of June, July, and August when stream and air temperatures increased, crushed ice was used to cool the water in the buckets holding fish, and worked well, as evidenced by the increased vigor in the fish.",

In June, a seine measuring 67 m long and 6.7 m deep with a mesh of 6.4 mm became the primary sampling gear used in the estuary and south slough. Because of the depth of the 67 m net, it could be landed on the levees with only a few unsuccessful sets caused by the net snagging on the rock riprap.

  "REDW_MWPC": "Substrate along the length of each reach was measured using a modified Wolman pebble count technique using a sampling frame and systematic sampling along a tape at one meter spacing. The sampling frame is constructed from aluminum bars, 2.5 by 0.9 cm (1 by 3/8 inch) in diameter with an inside diameter of 60 by 60 cm. For ease of transportation, the frame disassembles into eight pieces consisting of four corners and four straight pieces with a total length of 32.1 and 34.3 cm, respectively. Each individual segment of the frame is fitted with a sleeve (7.6 cm long) at one end and a spring lock mechanism at the other end. To connect individual segments of the frame, two segments are aligned so that the end containing the spring lock mechanism of one segment inserts into the sleeved end of the second segment. The connection is secured by the lever of the spring lock mechanism snapping into a machined slot in the sleeve. This procedure is repeated until all eight segments are connected forming the sampling frame. To disconnect the sampling frame, the spring lock is depressed so that the lever exits the opening in the sleeve allowing the segments to be separated. Small slots are cut at 5 cm increments along the outside edge of the frame to hold thin white elastic bands in place that are spanned horizontally and vertically across the frame to define the grid points. The spacing of the grid points is adjusted to a size equal to or larger than the stream bed Dm, or the dominant large particle size when sampling in a poorly sorted coarse gravel or cobble bed that contains boulders. The 60 by 60 cm frame accommodates four grid points when the elastic bands are spaced 30 cm from each other. A maximum of 121 grid points may be obtained by the closest possible grid spacing of 5 cm. The sampling frame is positioned at increments along a measuring tape. The selected particle can be visually identified below the intersections of the elastic bands, comparable to sampling along a tape measure. If flow is too deep or too fast to properly see the particle under the grid, a pointed index finger is placed in one corner of the grid intersection, and vertically lowered onto the streambed surface. The grid intersection serves as a guide for positioning the finger as it points toward the bed. This clearly defines the sampling location and improves the representative identification of the particle to be included in the sample. After a particle is selected, it is extracted from under one of the grid points, and its size is measured, with a standard square-hole sieves template.",

After the colonization period, plates were scraped with a plastic bristled brush to remove periphyton and rinsed with stream water filtered through a PUR water filter into a collecting tray. Periphyton scraped from the two plates in each riffle was composited for a total of one sample per riffle. The sample was filtered through a mesh net into a graduated cylinder to remove debris, mixed well and filtered onto pre-combusted 25 um glass fiber filters for Ash-Free Dry Mass determination, with volumes of water and sample noted.",
  "REDW_RAS": "The visual observation component of the survey consisted of two phases.  In the first phase, a diver counted the number of fish present in each unit selected for sampling.  The diver then used a second sampling probability to determine if a snorkeled unit will be selected for calibration; this is the second phase of the dive survey.  Calibration checked the accuracy of a diver?s counts so that a statistical relationship could be developed for the number of fish versus the number of fish observed.  Calibration was performed by two different methods: the Method of Bounded Counts (MBC) or depletion electrofishing.  Calibration by MBC required the diver to perform three additional dives on each selected unit, recording a separate count for each dive.  The MBC was only performed on units where twenty or less coho salmon were counted.  In units where more than twenty coho salmon were counted, depletion electrofishing was used to calibrate the diver?s counts.",

This weir, modified for use in Redwood Creek and Prairie Creek in 1983, was 3.0 m long, and was 1.5 m wide at the mouth. The throat of the weir was fitted with hinged wire mesh panels, a hinged inclined plane, and a removable holding basket. At high flows, only a portion of the total flow could be sampled. At low flows, the weir extended across the full width of the creek. In all years the weir was deployed on the same day once each week, usually from 1 May until 1 August. High flows resulting in equipment failure prevented sampling prior to 1 May in all years. The weir was always in place and functioning from 1900 h to 0800 h the following day in 1982 and 1983.

Every month, six riffle habitats were randomly selected for each reach using the stream habitat classification data collected during fall 1998 by the California Cooperative Fisheries Research Unit, Humboldt State University, Arcata, California. To calculate invertebrate densities and estimate mean individual biomass per unit area, riffles were sampled using a Surber sampler (net mesh size 350 um) that delineated a 0.093 square meter sample area. A single Surber sample was obtained from each selected riffle. The sample location within a given riffle was selected from an area in the thalweg that appeared to represent average substrate, flow and depth conditions in that riffle. Individual samples were rinsed from the Surber net into a sieve (mesh size 212um). To reduce sorting time and maintain specimen quality, samples containing large portions of sand and gravel were transferred to a plastic container where organic material was separated from the substrate using a super-saturated solution of sugar and water. Elutriation of a given sample was repeated until no invertebrates were observed in the solution or substrate.

  "SCCP_03FIS": "For the Southern California Coastal Water Research Project (SCCWRP) - Bight03 trawls, a semiballoon otter trawl was used to collect epibenthic invertebrates and demersal fish. The Field Operations Manual contained the trawl apparatus specifics (Bight03 Field Sampling & Logistics Committee 2003). The Bight'03 survey required two additions to the trawl specifications: 1) Non-crushable floats were required for any nets used to trawl deeper than 300 m; and 2) Lotek archival tags were attached to an otter trawl board to measure water temperature, depth and time of the individual trawls. Once started, the archival tag ran until its memory was full (approximately 12 hours), then shut off. To reduce the risk of losing data, the tag was downloaded at the end of each day. The collection of trawl data was largely a field activity for which there was little opportunity to clarify or correct errors. Therefore, it was important field personnel followed the set protocols. Trawl track passed the station coordinates no farther than 100 meters (200 meters for islands), and no more than +/- 10% of the target depth. The trawl track was plotted prior to sampling during a pre-trawl survey to verify depth with a fathometer and that the bottom had no obstructions. If the first run indicates the site was unacceptable, another survey was conducted. If this attempt was unsuccessful, a third attempt was conducted. The site was abandoned after three unsuccessful attempts. After a successful pre-trawl survey, the track coordinates were entered into the DGPS and retrieved during sampling to maintain the course along the trawl track. Trawls were towed along isobaths. While the vessel was underway the net and doors were placed in the water. The floats skimmed the surface and the net was not entangled prior to paying out the bridles. The bridles were paid out by personnel on either side of the net to avoid becoming tangled. After the net touched the bottom, a sufficient length of hydrowire (towing wire) was paid out to ensure the net was pulled from a horizontal rather than a vertical position. Trawling was conducted at a speed-over-ground of 1.0 m/sec (or 1.5-2.0 knots). At stations less than 300 meters water depth, the net was towed for 10 minutes, measured on deck from start to end of trawl (distance was equivalent to 450-600 meters). Trawl speed and distance was determined by DGPS. In confined areas (e.g. bays and harbors) the trawl duration was reduced to 5 minutes, or a distance of 225-300 meters. At stations greater than 300 meters water depth, the archival tag was downloaded immediately upon completion of the trawl and the on-bottom duration determined. If the on-bottom duration was less than 8 minutes or greater than 15 minutes, the trawl was repeated, adjusting the on-deck duration to close to 10 minutes of on-bottom time as possible. If there were demersal fish and invertebrates in trawls falling outside the on-bottom duration limits, the catch was processed while the station was being re-trawled and the data sheet was noted. At the end of the prescribed trawl time, the net was retrieved and brought onboard the vessel. The cod-end was opened and the catch deposited into a tub or holding tank. If the trawl was retrieved with little or no catch in the cod-end, it was evaluated whether the trawl was conducted properly. If any of the trawl procedures were not followed, if the net was fouled or torn (not allowing escapement), or if there was no evidence of contact with the bottom (from the Lotek information), the trawl was considered unacceptable and the site was retrawled. If retrawling the station was unsuccessful after another two attempts, the site was abandoned.",
  "SCCP_03SED": "For the Southern California Coastal Water Research Project (SCCWRP) - Bight03 grab samples, a 0.1 m2 modified Van Veen grab was used to collect sediment for physical, chemical, and infaunal analyses (Kahl Scientific Instrument Corporation, El Cajon, CA). The grab was galvanized, stainless steel, or Teflon-coated. Either single or tandem Van Veen grabs were acceptable. Prior to deployment, the grab was cocked with the safety key in place. The grab was hoisted over the side and the safety key removed. The grab was lowered at up to 2 meters/second until it was approximately 5 meters above the bottom, then lowered at 1 meter/second to minimize bow wave disturbance of the surface sediment. In water depths greater than 300 meters, sometimes the descent rate was reduced to less than 1 meter/second to avoid kiting and/or premature tripping. After bottom contact was made (indicated by slack in the winch wire), the tension on the wire was slowly increased, causing the lever arms to close the grab. Once the grab was back on board, the top doors were opened for inspection. Some sites were impossible or very difficult to grab sample due to different sediment types (e.g. cobble, gravel, well-sorted sands, etc.) and localities (e.g. canyons, slopes, and rocky areas). The minimal effort to justify site abandonment was as follows. If after 3 consecutive unsuccessful grab attempts at a site and up to 3 more consecutive unsuccessful attempts a second location within the radius limit and +/-10% of the target site depth (or 1 meter in estuaries), the station was abandoned and the reason was documented. If sampling success was intermittent, the site was abandoned after a minimum of 9 attempts. In this case, only the successfully collected sample types were processed and retained. Sampling failures from operational error (e.g., premature tripping) did not count towards the minimal effort. In habitats where sediments were unusually soft (e.g., estuary muds), it was necessary to remove the lead weights to prevent over-topping the grab. Upon retrieval of the grab, acceptability of the sample was based upon sample condition and depth of penetration. Sample condition was judged by surface disturbance, leakage, decanting, and washing. An acceptable sample condition was characterized by an even surface with minimal disturbance and little or no leakage of the overlying water. If approved, the overlying water was drained without disturbing the sediment surface (for benthic grab samples the water was captured and screened). Penetration depth was determined by inserting a plastic ruler vertically along the grab midline and measuring to the nearest 0.5 centimeter. Sediment penetration depth was at least 5 centimeters; however, penetration depths of 7-10+ centimeters were obtained in silt (fine sand to clay). If both sample condition and penetration were acceptable in the first grab, sampling at the station proceeded with the collection of chemistry and then sediment toxicity samples from successive grabs. All grabs taken at a station were of similar sediment type and depth penetration. The top 2 centimeters of the undisturbed surface was randomly sub-sampled from the grab with a new scoop or a scoop cleaned with soap and water and rinsed with de-ionized water. Sediment within 1 centimeter of the metal sides of the grab was avoided. The target volume for the sediment chemistry samples was 100 grams for grain size; 200 grams each for nutrients, metals, and trace organics; and 2.5 liters for toxicity. The minimum acceptable volume was 100 grams for sediment chemistry and 1.0 liters for toxicity. If less than the minimum was collected, the samples were discarded and the reasons recorded. When multiple grabs were needed to meet required sample volumes, the sediment from each grab was distributed evenly among sample containers. Once the acceptable volumes were reached, the sediment samples were processed for transport to the labs.",
  "SCCP_03SQU": "For the Southern California Coastal Water Research Project (SCCWRP) - Bight03 pelagic forage fish and squid field composite samples were collected from January to February 2003 and July 2003 to February 2004. Due to the patchy spatial distribution of pelagic forage fishes species within the Southern California Bight (SCB), fish and squid composite samples were randomly collected at several local commercial fishing ports along the southern California coast in an attempt to quantify contaminant concentrations in pelagic forage fishes found within the northern, central, southern, and island regions of the SCB. Composite samples were collected from both commercial landing markets and bait receivers along the southern California coast from the following locations listed from north to south: Ventura Harbor, Port Hueneme, Marina Del Rey, King Harbor, Los Angeles/Long Beach (LA/LB) Harbor, Newport Harbor, Oceanside, and San Diego. Fishing location was determined from landing receipts or directly from fishing captain or bait receiver tender. Fishing location was typically provided as a California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG) fishing block, a number identifying a 10 mi x 10 mi (16 x 16 km) block encompassing a 100 mi2 (260 km2) square area within the SCB. Block numbers were designated for fishing location when only a geographic landmark was provided. Species selection was based on fish comprising the greatest biomass in the SCB and also whether the species was a favored prey item by either marine birds or mammals. The species selected for contaminant analysis were northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax), Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax), Pacific chub mackerel (Scomber japonicus), and the California market squid (Loligo opalescens). At the fish market, samplers systematically sampled fish from fish bins throughout an entire fishing vessel load during the offloading process. Samplers wrapped fish or squid in aluminum foil and placed them in a plastic zip-lock bag with a bag tag that included species name, date, fishing block or general location, and port. After sample collection, each field composite (consisting of 25 individuals) was returned to the laboratory, rinsed in deionized water, wrapped in foil, and frozen until sample processing. Samples were collected from four predetermined strata (or regions) within the SCB consisting of three coastal regions (north, central, south) and an islands region. A power analysis was performed using data collected during a pilot study conducted in January-February 2003. Using results from this analysis, the objective was to collect 10 field composites per species per region (except for Pacific chub mackerel, with a target of 3 composites per region), for a total of 160 composites. For species targeted for 10 composites per region, samples were distributed as evenly as possible over the summer and non-summer months of the sampling period.",
  "SCCP_03TIS": "To investigate bioaccumulation of trace metals contamination, the Southern California Coastal Water Research Project (SCCWRP) - Bight03 sampled fish tissue. Fish were collected by trawl; please see Field Operations Manual for details (Bight03 Field Sampling & Logistics Committee 2003). The fish bioaccumulation study utilized sanddab guild species, including the following: speckled sanddab (Citharichthys stigmaeus); longfin sanddab (Citharichthys xanthostigma); Pacific sanddab (Citharichthys sordidus); gulf sanddab (Citharichthys fragilis); slender sole (Lyopsetta exilis); small (<20 cm) petrale sole (Eopsetta jordani), and small (<20 cm) juvenile California halibut (Paralichthys californicus). A sample composite consisted of 6 fish of a single species and age class. Composites were made for each age class of all sanddab guild species collected at a station, if at least six fish of an age class for each species was present. Bioaccumulation fish were collected from the first trawl at a predetermined station after the catch has been processed for assemblage data. If no individuals of the sanddab guild were encountered during the first trawl, the station was abandoned. If six individuals of an age class of a species were collected during the first trawl, tissue sampling at that station was complete and no additional trawling was necessary. If sanddab guild species were collected in the first trawl, but with fewer than 6 individuals in an age class, additional trawls were required to complete an entire composite. If an insufficient number of fish were collected for bioaccumulation by the end of the third trawl (30 minutes total trawl time for all 3 attempts combined), then no further trawl samples were necessary and the station was abandoned. At the end of trawling at a station, all complete composites were packaged, labeled and frozen for all sanddab guild species (i.e. any age of any species with six fish).",
  "SCCP_77BEN": "In 1977, benthic grab samples were collected for the Southern California Coastal Water Research Project (SCCWRP). The samples were taken from stations distributed at approximately 10-kilometer intervals between Point Conception and the Mexican Border. In certain areas near the major municipal wastewater outfalls, stations were more closely spaced to delineate the expected outfall effects. Six stations had questionable data and were not included in this database, including 3 stations in Point Loma (R65, R66, R67). Navigation was accomplished using LORAN.  Coordinates were later converted using Global Positioning System (GPS) and were based upon North American Datum 27 (NAD 27).  Depth was measured using a fathometer. Latitude (degrees North), longitude (degrees West), and elevation/depth was the recorded position at the time of sampling. Stations were sampled at 60 m because most of the major outfalls discharge at this depth. The maximum depth at the station is equal to the depth of the sample since the samples were taken from the bottom. A 0.1 meter-square, modified chain-rigged Van Veen grab sampler was used to obtain sediment samples for infaunal analysis. Two replicate grab samples were collected to a minimum of 10 cm, as penetration depths on this order have been shown to collect a minimum of 90 percent of the individuals and species typically found in southern California bottom sediments. Macrobenthic infauna were separated from the sediment by sieving through a stacked set of screens with square mesh sizes of 2.5, 1.0, and 0.5 mm. The animals and debris collected on each size of screen were fixed in 10% borax buffered formalin in seawater.  The infaunal samples were sorted at the SCCWRP Lab. The studies were designed so that the data from the 1977 60-Meter Control Survey, and the 1985 and 1990 Reference Site Surveys could be compared to each other.",

  "SCCP_94BEN": "For the Southern California Coastal Water Research Project (SCCWRP), Bight94, a 0.1 m2 modified chain-rigged Van Veen grab collected sediment samples for infaunal analysis. The grab was galvanized, stainless steel, or Teflon-coated. All surfaces were clean and rust-free. Single or tandem Van Veen grabs were acceptable. Before deployment, the grab was cocked with the safety key. The grab was hoisted over the side, the safety key removed, and the grab was lowered at 2 m/sec until 5 m above the bottom. Then it was lowered at 1 m/sec to minimize bow wave disturbance. After bottom contact was made (slack lowering wire), the tension on the wire was slowly increased and the lever arms closed. Back on board, the top doors were opened and the acceptability of the sample was rated. Acceptable sample condition included an even surface, minimal surface disturbance, and little or no leakage of overlying water. The overlying water was drained off the sample and captured for screening with the sediments. Sediment penetration depth was determined by inserting a plastic ruler vertically along the grab midline and measuring the sediment depth to the nearest 0.5 cm. The depth was at least 5 cm (depths of 7-10 cm occurred in silt). After the sample description was completed, the infaunal sample was washed from the grab. All wash waters were filtered to prevent introduction of surface-water organisms. After washing the sediment from the grab, transfer it to a sediment washing table for screening. Capture all water drained from the grab, grab sample, and wash water, usually by a large-capacity tub (>70 L capacity) positioned under the grab. Gently break up the sediment before it runs off the table into the screen box. The screen box had stainless steel mesh with 1.0-mm openings. Wire diameter was similar to a U.S. Standard 1.00 mm Sieve (0.58 mm). Surface area of the screen was 1500-2100 cm2. Water pressure and direction were controlled to avoid damaging the organisms. Once the sample was washed through the screen, transfer the debris, coarse sediment, and organisms on the screen to a sample container. The sample container was labeled with both an external adhesive label and internal waterproof label giving the station name, depth, date, and split number (i.e. 1 of 2, 2 of 2, etc.), if applicable. The sample container was sufficiently large to hold the sample material, fixative, and relaxant. Splitting samples was avoided, if possible, by having a broad range of sample container sizes. The material retained on the screen was gently removed, avoiding damaging the organisms. The sample container was filled to about 40% capacity with screened material (not >50%). Organisms caught in the mesh were removed with forceps and added to the container. The screen box was thoroughly washed and scrubbed before screening the next sample. The infaunal sample was placed in a relaxant, such MgSO4 (Epsom salts) prior to fixation. For Epsom salts, 1 kg MgSO4 per 20 L of seawater was added to the container to 85-90%. Close the container and invert several times to distribute the solution. Record the volume of relaxant and let sit 30 min. After 30 min top off the container with sodium borate buffered formalin solution to reach about 10% formalin solution. Buffered formalin (a 37% formaldehyde solution) was made by mixing 50 g Na2B4O7 (sodium borate) per liter of formalin. Close the sample container, invert several times, and store for return to the laboratory.",

Pre-trawl surveys were conducted to prevent damage to trawl gear. A semiballoon otter trawl was used to collect epibenthic invertebrates and demersal fish. Net dimensions were: 7.6-m head rope (25 ft); 8.8-m foot rope (29 ft); 3.8-cm (1.5 in) body mesh; and a 1.3-cm cod-end mesh (0.5 in). This net had 22.9-m (75 ft.) long bridles made of 1.0-1.6 cm (3/8 to 5/8 in.) diameter rope (e.g., Samson braid). The otter boards (doors) had a width of 76.2 cm (30 in.), height of 50.8 cm (20 in.), and a suggested weight of 15.9 kg (35 lb). The door chains were 5-mm (3/16 in.) in diameter and had the following numbers of links: front top=12; front bottom=11; back top=17; back bottom=16. The chief scientist kept a trawl data log. The trawl was prepared prior to trawling so that the net can be deployed in an orderly and safe manner. Trawls were towed along isobaths. After the net touched the bottom, the hydrowire (towing wire) was deployed to ensure the net was pulled horizontally, rather than vertically, to sample fishes residing at the sediment-water interface. Once on the bottom, the net was towed for 10 min at a speed of 1.0 m/sec (3.3 ft/sec or 2.0 kn), a distance of about 600 m. Trawl speed and distance were determined by differential GPS. At the end of 10 min, the net was brought on board the boat. The cod-end was opened and the catch was dumped into a tub or holding tank.

Acceptable sample condition is characterized by an even surface, with minimal surface disturbance, and little or no leakage of the overlying water. While some humping will be evident in samples from firm bottoms where penetration has been poor, this is due to the closing action of the grab and is not evidence of unacceptable washing. If the sample condition is acceptable, the overlying water is drained off and the depth of penetration determined. The overlying water in grabs intended for infaunal samples may be drained but all drained water must be captured for screening with the sediments. Extra caution should be taken to drain the overlying water from the grabs for chemistry and toxicity samples. It is recommended that siphoning or decanting be employed for these grabs to avoid disturbance and loss of the surface sediments. For infaunal samples, sediment penetration depth must be at least 5 cm; however, penetration depths of 7-10 cm should be obtainable in silt (fine sand to clay). The depth of penetration is determined by insertion of a plastic ruler vertically along the grab midline and measurement of the depth of sediment to the nearest 0.5 cm. Sediment grain-size and chemistry (e.g., TOC, trace metals, trace organics) samples will be collected from the top 2 cm by randomly subsampling undisturbed surface material with a stainless-steel, Teflon-coated or HDPE scoop. The scoop should be replaced if any signs of rust are visible. Sediment in contact with or within 1 cm of the metal sides of the grab should be avoided to reduce the chance of sample contamination. Care should be taken not to touch any surfaces of the Van Veen grab sampler with the scoop. At a minimum, the scoop will be washed with soap and water and rinsed with deionized (DI) water between stations. It may also be rinsed with methanol, followed by acetone, hexane, or methylene chloride between stations but these must be disposed of as Hazardous Materials. Use of a new scoop with each sample is also acceptable. Samples should be placed in precleaned containers for analysis of grain size (1 L plastic), TOC/TN (500 mL glass), trace organics (500 mL glass), and trace metals (500 mL glass). Sediment chemistry sample containers should have Teflon-lined lids (this is not a requirement for sediment grain-size samples). An air space should be left at the top of each sample. Sediment grain-size samples should be stored at approximately 4o C by placing them on wet ice or in a refrigerator until returned to the laboratory within a week (not frozen). Sediment chemistry samples may be stored at <4o C by placing them on wet ice or in a refrigerator but must be frozen at -20o C within 24 hr. If frozen, they should be returned to the laboratory within a week. If not frozen, they should be returned within 24 hr.",
  "SCCP_94TIS": "For the Southern California Coastal Water Research Project (SCCWRP), Bight94, the correct collection permits were obtained before trawling. Pre-trawl surveys were conducted to prevent damage to trawl gear. A semiballoon otter trawl was used to collect epibenthic invertebrates and demersal fish. Net dimensions were: 7.6-m head rope (25 ft); 8.8-m foot rope (29 ft); 3.8-cm (1.5 in) body mesh; and a 1.3-cm cod-end mesh (0.5 in). This net had 22.9-m (75 ft.) long bridles made of 1.0-1.6 cm (3/8 to 5/8 in.) diameter rope (e.g., Samson braid). The otter boards (doors) had a width of 76.2 cm (30 in.), height of 50.8 cm (20 in.), and a suggested weight of 15.9 kg (35 lb). The door chains were 5-mm (3/16 in.) in diameter and had the following numbers of links: front top=12; front bottom=11; back top=17; back bottom=16. The chief scientist kept a trawl data log. The trawl was prepared prior to trawling so that the net can be deployed in an orderly and safe manner. Trawls were towed along isobaths. After the net touched the bottom, the hydrowire (towing wire) was deployed to ensure the net was pulled horizontally, rather than vertically, to sample fishes residing at the sediment-water interface. Once on the bottom, the net was towed for 10 min at a speed of 1.0 m/sec (3.3 ft/sec or 2.0 kn), a distance of about 600 m. Trawl speed and distance were determined by differential GPS. At the end of 10 min, the net was brought on board the boat. The cod-end was opened and the catch was dumped into a tub or holding tank. More information on trawling specifics is in the Field Operations Manual. Following processing of the catch for population data, target species were then removed from the rest of the catch. Select species were targeted for tissue contamination analysis, including Citharichthys sordidus, C. xanthostigma, and Microstomus pacificus. If no target species were collected in the first trawl, sampling was considered to be complete, and field crews moved on to the next station. If target species were taken in the first trawl, additional trawls (two 10-min trawls or one 20-min trawl) were conducted to collect sufficient numbers of fish for composites. No more than three trawls were conducted at any station to collect tissue samples. The bioaccumulation study required 5 to 10 g of liver per station for each target species. If the available species at a station were sanddabs (Citharichthys spp.), then at least 15 individuals larger than 8 cm maximum (Standard Length) were required for each composite of a species; for Dover sole (Microstomus pacificus), at least 10 individuals larger than 12 cm were required. Each target species was placed in separate Ziploc bags and immediately frozen for transport to the processing facility on land.",

  "SCCP_98SED": "A 0.1 m2 modified Van Veen grab sampler was used to collect sediment samples for physical, chemical, and infaunal analysis in the Southern California Coastal Water Research Project (SCCWRP) - Bight98. This device is manufactured by Kahl Scientific Instrument Corporation, 737 West Main Street, El Cajon, California 92022 (619/444-2158). The grab sampler may be galvanized, stainless steel, or Teflon-coated.  All surfaces of the grab must be clean and free of rust.  Either single or tandem Van Veen grabs are acceptable.  Prior to deployment, the grab is cocked with the safety key in place.  The grab is then hoisted over the side, the safety key is removed, the grab is lowered at 2 m/sec until it is 5 m above the bottom where it is then lowered at 1 m/sec to minimize the effects of bow wave disturbance of the surface sediment.  After bottom contact has been made (indicated by slack in the winch wire), the tension on the wire is slowly increased, causing the lever arms to close the grab. Once the grab is back on board, the top doors are opened for inspection.  The first grab collected at a site should be used for the benthic infaunal sample.  The chemistry and sediment toxicity samples will be collected from subsequent grabs.  Different sediment types (e.g. cobble, gravel, well sorted sands) and localities (e.g., canyons, slopes, rocky areas) may be difficult to sample.  Sediments containing rocks create the most common problem by preventing complete closure of the grab by allowing sediment to wash out during retrieval.  Some of the Bight'98 sampling sites may occur on these difficult sediment types or localities because of the randomized sampling design.  Therefore, if after three unsuccessful attempts at a site and up to three more unsuccessful attempts at each of two other locations (within 100 m distance from and ±10% of the depth of the nominal site), the station should be abandoned. Samples for the various analyses were collected from the top 2 cm of the grab and at least 1 cm away from the metal sides of the sampling device. An appropriate amount of sample was collected using a Teflon-coated metal or plastic scoop and into a pre-cleaned container supplied by the laboratories performing the respective analyses. All sample containers were purchased pre-cleaned, and were certified to meet EPA standards. Glass containers with TeflonÒ-lined closures (500 mL) were used for all samples except those for AVS-SEM (acid volatile sulfide-simultaneously extracted metals; cadmium, chromium, mercury, nickel, lead, and zinc). AVS-SEM were collected in polycarbonate centrifuge bottles (250 mL). After collection samples were stored on ice or in a refrigerator at 4° C until returned to the laboratory. As soon as possible after collection, samples were distributed to the appropriate laboratories for analysis. At the lab, samples for AVS-SEM, grain size, and mineralogy, were kept at 4° C until analyzed (i.e., not frozen). Samples for trace organic, metals, and TOC analysis were frozen (-20°C) within 24 h.",

The fish bioaccumulation study targeted two categories of fish. Category 1 included Citharichthys stigmaeus, Citharichthys xanthostigma, Citharichthys sordidus, and small (<20 cm) juvenile Paralichthys californicus, which cover the data presented here. More specifics on Category species is in the Field Operations Manual. For Category 1 species, a sample composite consisted of six fish of an age class and at each station composites were made for each age class. Bioaccumulation fish were collected from the first trawl at a station after it has been processed for assemblage data. If no individuals of Category I species were encountered during the first trawl, no additional trawls were required. If six individuals of an age class of a Category I species were collected during the first trawl, tissue sampling at that station was complete. If category I species were collected in the first trawl, but with fewer than six individuals in an age class, additional trawls were required to complete an entire composite until six individuals were collected (limit three trawls total). By the end of the third trawl (30 min total trawl time), if an insufficient number of fish were collected for bioaccumulation, no further trawl samples were collected. Whole fish age-class composite samples for each species were packaged in Ziploc plastic bags, labeled, and placed on dry ice or in a freezer for transport to the laboratory.",

Then it was lowered at 1 m/sec to minimize bow wave disturbance. After bottom contact was made (slack lowering wire), the tension on the wire was slowly increased and the lever arms closed. Back on board, the top doors were opened and the acceptability of the sample was rated. Acceptable sample condition included an even surface, minimal surface disturbance, and little or no leakage of overlying water. The overlying water was drained off the sample. The sediment was used for three different types of toxicity tests: amphipod survival, Qwiklite luminescence, and P450 human reporter gene system (HRGS) test. When taking sediment toxicity samples, the sediment from the grabs was proportionally distributed into each sample container. A 1.5 L minimum was required for sediment toxicity analysis, with at least 60 mL in the Qwiklite sample container. The station was considered completed if 1.5 L of sediment had been collected with 5 or more grabs. If the required minimum 1.5 L was collected with fewer than 5 grabs, then additional grabs were taken until either 2.0 L was collected, or 5 total sediment toxicity grabs were taken. Sediment from all toxicity stations was sampled for the amphipod survival test. Additional sediment from a subset of these stations was collected for the Qwiklite test. Organic solvent extracts for P450 HRGS analysis were obtained from surface sediment samples collected for hydrocarbon analysis. Separate samples were required for each test. Sample containers were provided by the laboratories performing the required analysis. High-density polyethylene (HDPE) containers were used for collection of amphipod and Qwiklite sediment samples. Sediment samples for amphipod and Qwiklite tests were collected from the top 2 cm by sampling the undisturbed surface material with a scoop. Scoops were made of plastic (e.g.,HDPE, Teflon, polycarbonate) or Teflon-coated material. Contact with sediment within 1 cm of the metal sides of the grab was avoided. Sample volume requirements for each test were: Amphipod ? 2.25 L (minimum of 1.25 L), distributed into two 1L containers and a 250 mL container; and, Qwiklite ? 125 mL (placed in a 250 mL container). The P450 HRGS samples were collected with a plastic, stainless steel, or Teflon-coated metal scoop and placed in a 0.25 L plastic or glass container with a Teflon-lined lid. The P450 HRGS samples were initially placed on wet ice and then frozen within 24 h of collection. Sediments were not homogenized in the field. Each labeled container for the amphipod survival or Qwiklite test was held in the field, or SCCWRP laboratory, on wet ice, or in a refrigerator at 4o C, for no more than three days before transport to the designated toxicity laboratories. The inter-laboratory transport time did not exceed 24 hours. Upon arrival to the analytical laboratory, the amphipod survival and Qwiklite test samples were stored at 4oC. Testing began within two weeks of sample collection except where noted in the data set. Chain of custody procedures were followed throughout the sampling and analysis procedures.  Any sample collection equipment which came in contact with the sediment was cleaned between stations. Collection equipment was stored in plastic bags.

Back on board, the top doors were opened and the acceptability of the sample was rated. Acceptable sample condition included an even surface, minimal surface disturbance, and little or no leakage of overlying water. The overlying water was drained off the sample and captured for screening with the sediments. Sediment penetration depth was determined by inserting a plastic ruler vertically along the grab midline and measuring the sediment depth to the nearest 0.5 cm. The depth was at least 5 cm (depths of 7-10 cm occurred in silt). After the sample description was completed, the infaunal sample was washed from the grab. All wash waters were filtered to prevent introduction of surface-water organisms. After washing the sediment from the grab, transfer it to a sediment washing table for screening. Capture all water drained from the grab, grab sample, and wash water, usually by a large-capacity tub (>70 L capacity) positioned under the grab. Gently break up the sediment before it runs off the table into the screen box. The screen box had stainless steel mesh with 1.0-mm openings. Wire diameter was similar to a U.S. Standard 1.00 mm Sieve (0.58 mm). Surface area of the screen was 1500-2100 cm2. Water pressure and direction were controlled to avoid damaging the organisms. Once the sample was washed through the screen, transfer the debris, coarse sediment, and organisms on the screen to a sample container. The sample container was labeled with both an external adhesive label and internal waterproof label giving the station name, depth, date, and split number (i.e. 1 of 2, 2 of 2, etc.), if applicable. The sample container was sufficiently large to hold the sample material, fixative, and relaxant. Splitting samples was avoided, if possible, by having a broad range of sample container sizes. The material retained on the screen was gently removed, avoiding damaging the organisms. The sample container was filled to 50-70% capacity with screened material. Organisms caught in the mesh were removed with forceps and added to the container. The screen box was thoroughly washed and scrubbed before screening the next sample. A relaxant solution (either Epsom salts, MgSO4, at 1kg/20L; or propylene phenoxytol at 30 ml/20L) was used to treat the infaunal samples for approximately 30 minutes prior to fixation. Relaxant solutions may be used as the diluent water for the fixative, or may be decanted after exposure and replaced with diluted fixative. If it is used as diluent water, fill the sample container to 85 to 90% of its volume, close the container and invert it several times to distribute the solution. Leave the sample in the relaxant for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes top off the container with enough sodium borate buffered formaldehyde to achieve a 10% formalin solution. Close the container, once again, and invert it several times to assure mixing. Store the sample for return to the laboratory.",

  "SCPN_L1": "Three major techniques were used for collecting water-quality samples and determining field parameters. Each technique was appropriate for the type of site being sampled: well, spring, or river. Water samples from wells were collected from a faucet near the wellhead and prior to any water treatment such as disinfection, softening, or filtration. Polyethylene tubing connected the faucet of a well to a splitter that directed water to a flow-through chamber, a sample line and an overflow line. A Hydrolab minisonde multi-parameter probe was used in conjunction with a closed flow-through chamber to determine field parameters. Wells were purged at least three well volumes and until field parameter stability criteria stabilized for two readings at 15 minute intervals; the pH within +/- 0.1 units, temperature +/- 0.2°Celcius, specific conductance ± 5 percent, and dissolved oxygen ± 0.3 mg/L.  Following purging, water samples were filtered and collected from the sample line and bacterial samples were collected directly from the faucet.\n\nWater samples collected from springs were collected as close to the source as possible. Teflon tubing was used to direct flow into a sampling bottle when necessary. When no flow was present, but water was pooled, a peristaltic pump was used to pump water directly through filters and into sample bottles. Field parameters were measured using individual hand-held meters.\n\nRivers, streams, and creeks were sampled using integrated samples when possible. Equal-width-increment or multiple-vertical-integrated samples were collected when possible.

  "USGS_COLM": "Because of the small volumes of water at sampling sites, water-quality samples from intermittent streams and springs were collected as point (grab) samples.  Water samples for chemical analysis were composited in a 3-liter bottle.  The bottle was cleaned to the specifications of the USGS National Field Manual (U.S. Geological Survey, 1998 and Horowitz and others, 1994) before samples were collected.  Tritium samples were collected in 500-milliliter high density polyethylene bottles directly from the water source.  Streams were too shallow to use depth-integrating samplers; therefore, using 1-liter sediment bottles, suspended-sediment samples were collected as point samples from the centroid of flow. Except for water temperature and specific conductance measurements, other field measurements and sample processing had to be completed offsite for most sites because of the remote location of the sites.  The water samples were carried back to a field truck for sample processing.  Samples were processed within about ½ hour to 3 hours after collection, depending on the time required to hike out from the site.  Filtered samples were collected from the composite sample.  Samples for the analysis of bacteria were collected at the sampling site in a sterilized 1-liter glass bottle.  Bacteria-sample processing and the Winkler titrations for dissolved oxygen were done at the USGS office in Grand Junction. Discharge or flow rate was measured or estimated during the water-sample collection, if possible. Where discharge of streams was measured, current meters or the float method (to estimate velocity) was used (Rantz and others, 1982).  Flow from springs either was estimated visually or measured using the volumetric method (Rantz and others, 1982).  Some sampling sites consisted of pools with no discernible flow.\n\nTemperature, pH, and specific conductance were measured using meters by methods outlined by the USGS (1998).  Dissolved oxygen was measured either with a meter or by the Winkler titration method. Samples for bacteria were analyzed for concentrations of fecal coliform by using membrane filtration methods described by the USGS (1998). Fecal coliforms were analyzed using m-FC agar media.  Except for the analysis of tritium and suspended sediment, all other constituents (major ions, nutrients, and trace elements) were analyzed by the USGS National Water Quality Laboratory in Lakewood, Colorado.  Analytical procedures used at the National Water Quality Laboratory are described by Faires (1993), Fishman and Friedman (1989), Fishman (1993), Garbarino (1999), McLain (1993), and National Water Quality Laboratory (1999).  Tritium was analyzed by the USGS Isotope Tracers Project laboratory in Menlo Park, California, by a method described in Thatcher and others (1977).  Suspended-sediment samples were analyzed by the USGS sediment laboratory in Iowa City, Iowa, by a method described in Guy (1969).",
  "USGS_CUIS": "All samples were collected and processed according to USGS protocols (Wilde and others, 1999a, b; Shelton, 1994). Dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, water temperature, and SC were measured in situ using multiprobe field meters (Hydrolab) that were calibrated daily. Turbidities and tannin and lignin were analyzed using a portable field spectrophotometer (Hach, model DR/2010). Tannin and lignin were analyzed using the Tyrosine method (Hach Company, 1997, method 8193; and Thurman, 1985). Field alkalinities were determined using a digital titrator (Hach, model 16900) and the incremental titration method (Wilde and Radke, 1998, p. alk-13 to alk-27). Water samples collected for major ions, trace elements, and nutrients were preserved and analyzed at USGS laboratories in Atlanta, Ga., or Ocala, Fla. (Fishman, 1993). Quality-control and quality-assurance samples were collected during each sampling trip, and included field replicates and inorganic blank water samples analyzed in conjunction with environmental samples.\n\nWater temperature and SC sensors (USGS-Hydrologic Instrumentation Facility sensors and Campbell Scientific, Inc. CR-10 data recorders) recorded data once per hour when sensors were operating correctly from April 1999 to July 2000 at the Whitney outflow and the Lake Retta outflow. Because of the relatively harsh near-shore environment, the remoteness of these sites, and the limited number of site visits, data-collection rates were about 31 percent for the Whitney outflow sensor and 75 percent for the Lake Retta outflow sensor. Data collected from these instruments were used to assess changes in water temperature and SC of the outflows to the beach that may indicate changes in the relative contribution of fresh and seawater near the instruments. Data collected from these instruments were compared to data collected from nearby oceanic and climatic stations to discern major influences on SC in the outflows.\n\nWater samples from the near-shore Atlantic Ocean were collected to determine enterococci concentrations at five recreational beaches near roads or trail access points on Cumberland Island. Once per day during a 5-day period from April 26-30, 1999, dip samples were collected from two depths in the wave zone - where the Atlantic Ocean was about 1.5 and 3 ft deep. Samples were chilled while transported to a field laboratory. Maximum sample hold times were less than 3 hours. Samples were processed using membrane filtration (Myers and Wilde, 1999); enterococci concentrations are expressed as col/100 mL of water. Quality-control and quality-assurance samples for enterococci included field-replicate and blank samples processed in conjunction with environmental samples.",
  "USGS_CUISF": "Multiple seine hauls were conducted using a 10-ft by 6-ft seine (1/8-inch mesh) to collect fish from each water body. Seining was continued until at least three consecutive seine hauls yielded no new species of fish. At Whitney Lake, seining was used to sample only the shallow, near-shore areas?the deeper, open-water habitat was not sampled. Voucher specimens were preserved in 10 percent formalin and verified by the staff ecologist in the USGS Georgia District Office. All fish and invertebrate specimens retained as part of this study were given to Cumberland Island National Seashore for archival purposes.",
  "USGS_CUISI": "Aquatic invertebrates and fishes were collected at six of the surface-water sites in April and December 1999. Similar sampling efforts were expended while collecting fishes and invertebrates in each wetland during spring and fall sampling to discern seasonal differences between sampling dates and among sites. Except for collections made at Whitney Lake, all habitat types present at each wetland were sampled.\n\nSemiquantitative (relative-abundance) samples of aquatic-invertebrate communities were collected using a timed method of sweeping and kicking with D-frame nets (210-micron mesh). Effort expended ranged from 1 to 2 person hours per site, but varied depending on the amount of available habitat at each water body. At each water body, sampling efforts were identical for April and December. Large and rare invertebrates were separated from the main body of samples in the field and preserved in 10 percent formalin. Both components of each invertebrate sample were returned to the USGS Georgia District Office in Atlanta, Ga., where smaller invertebrates were removed under magnification from the main body of the sample. Identifications were made by the USGS National Water-Quality Laboratory Biology Group, Denver, CO.",

Field parameters, dissolved oxygen, pH, specific conductance, and water temperature were measured with the use of a calibrated Yellow Springs Instrument 556 multi-parameter probe.",
  "USGS_LIBO": "Because the presence of water at three of the four surface-water-sampling sites is ephemeral, sampling trips were scheduled and coordinated based on National Weather Service radar imagery and conversations with park personnel.  If precipitation was insufficient to cause sustained flow at the time of the USGS sampling visit, no sample was collected.\n\nSurface-water samples were collected from the stock pond by USGS personnel in a boat. Depth to the pond bottom was measured with a weighted tape, and the midpoint between the water surface and pond bottom was determined.  A polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) hose connected to a peristaltic pump was lowered to the middle depth of the pond with a pole.  Surface-water samples from ephemeral stream 3, the unnamed ditch, and parking-lot runoff were collected with a pump because the streamflow at each sampling point was less than 0.25 ft3/s; this nonisokinetic technique provided a well-mixed sample with minimal disturbance of the streambed sediment. When flowing, water depths at the sampling sites of the ephemeral stream, the unnamed ditch, and the parking-lot runoff were less than 1 ft and were too small to apply equal-depth increment or equal-width increment techniques. For field-parameter measurement and sample collection, a site was selected where the streamflow appeared to integrate water from the full width and depth of the stream (or flowing water in the parking lot).  A PTFE hose was fixed in the horizontal and vertical center of flow and connected to a peristaltic pump on a platform on the streambank.  Another PTFE hose was connected to the outlet of the pump and fixed to a portable lab stand.  The PTFE hose was flushed with stream water before the samples were collected. Unfiltered samples were collected first.  Next, the hose was connected to a 0.45-ìm pore-size capsule filter, and the filtered samples were collected.\n\nUsing procedures consistent with the USGS Field Manual for the Collection of Water-Quality Data (Wilde and Radtke, variously dated), pH, specific conductance, water temperature, and dissolved oxygen were measured with an electrometric multimeter.  Turbidity samples were measured with a portable nephelometric turbidimeter.  The amount of water transported in a stream can affect water quality and contaminant transport.   Measurements were made, using a current meter and methods described in Rantz and others (1982), Carter and Davidian (1968), Buchanan and Somers (1969), and Smoot and Novak (1968).  Streamflow was measured at a stream cross section at or near the water-sampling site immediately after sampling was completed.\n\nTo collect the ground-water sample from Lincoln Spring, a submersible, positive-displacement pump was placed near the bottom of the well during purging and sampling.  The well was pumped for about 2 hours about 1 month before sampling to purge stagnant water; it was pumped again on the day of sampling for about 1 hour to obtain samples representative of water in the aquifer.  Water temperature, pH, and specific conductance were monitored during pumping until the values stabilized.  The sampling pump and hose were cleaned before the well was sampled.  Procedures followed were (a) the external surfaces of the pump and hose that were submerged during sampling were rinsed with a deionized (DI) water spray, (b) about 5 gal of adilute solution of phosphate-free detergent and DI water were recirculated through the pump and hose for about 3 to 5 minutes, and (c) about 10 gal of DI water were pumped through the hose.\n\nSamples for chemical analysis were preserved in the field, chilled, and shipped on ice by overnight freight to the USGS National Water Quality Laboratory in Denver, Colorado.  Samples for suspended-sediment analysis were shipped to the USGS Sediment Laboratory in Louisville, Kentucky.",
  "USGS_MORU": "Water-quality samples were collected four times from all but one of the sites located throughout the Memorial.  The unnamed tributary (site 6) was only sampled three times because it was completely frozen in January 2001.  Field measurements of water temperature, air temperature, pH, specific conductance, and dissolved oxygen were made at each site prior to the initiation of sample collection activities.\n\nSurface-water samples were collected using standard USGS protocols outlined by Horowitz and others (1994) and by Shelton (1994).  Surface-water samples were collected as a grab sample near the centroid of flow because limited with and depth made collection of integrated cross-sectional samples impractical.  Aliquots of surface water were carefully collected and composited in pre-cleaned 8-liter churn splitters and covered to reduce the potential for external contamination.\n\nThe public-supply well was sampled using methods outlined by Koterba and others (1996).  A flow-through chamber was used to obtain field measurements at the well so that contact with the atmosphere was limited.  Samples were collected after field measurements stabilized.\n\nSamples for the analysis of common ions, nutrients, and trace metals were shipped overnight on ice to the USGS National Water Quality Laboratory (NWQL) and analyzed using methods described by Fishman and Friedman (1989) and Fishman (1993).  Samples for bacteria were collected in pre-sterilized bottles and kept on ice until delivered to a local contract laboratory within hours following collection.  Samples for the analysis of benzene, ethyl benzene, toluene, and xylene (BTEX) were collected as grab samples and kept chilled until analyzed using the Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) technique in the USGS South Dakota Water Science Center laboratory.  A single sample collected from the public-supply well in April was chilled and shipped overnight to the NWQL for analysis for confirmation of total BTEX compounds.",

Triplicate 20-ml aliquots were collected in pre-cleaned test tubes and fixed with persulfate oxidizing reagent and transported to the CACO laboratory for total nitrogen and phosphorus samples.  Sixty-ml sample bottles for dissolved nutrients was filled with water, filtered through 0.4 micrometer Millipore filters, preserved 2-3 drops of  2 N hydrochloric acid and iced for transport to CACO.  Standardized 60-ml vials were filled and placed on ice for fecal coliform analysis.  All samples was kept in the dark at 4 degrees C until analysis.  Nutrient samples were not analyzed for four to six months because of mechanical and logistical problems at the CACO laboratory that have since been resolved before processing these samples.",
  "WICR-MILLW": "Miller collected water samples in 2004-2005 and 2007 at each site at each sample time in 500 ml polyethylene bottles using one of two methods, depending on how safe it was to enter the stream. In addition, each sample run was classified as either 'baseflow' or 'storm' depending on the general runoff conditions (i.e. the continuing presence of rain during the sample period). Baseflow samples or any samples collected when the stream could be safely entered on foot, consisted of grab samples: bottles and lids were rinsed three times in free-flowing stream water and then a sample was collected by inverting the bottle to approximately 0.6 of depth and then turning up the opening to allow water to enter while sweeping the bottle across the stream width to achieve an integrated flow sample. Care was taken to insure that bottom sediment was not disturbed by sampling activity: the bottle was not allowed to contact the bottom, and sampling occurred upstream of the technician and upstream of or previous to other data-gathering activities. A DH-48 hand-held depth-integrated sampler was used when entering the stream was unsafe. The DH-48 was designed to collect suspended sediment samples in a controlled and repeatable manner from a depth-wise cross-section of a stream. Filling time of the sample bottle was directly related to stream velocity and an artificially concentrated suspended sediment sample can be created if the bottle is overfilled and water allow to cycle through the container (Federal Interagency Sedimentation Project, FISP). This unit, with handle extensions, was deployed from bridges in the following way: a bottle was attached to the sampler and immersed in the water (to as close to 0.6 of depth as possible) and swept across the stream width to collect a cross-sectionally integrated flow sample. Care was taken to avoid disturbing bottom sediment with the sampler and to avoid overfilling the sample bottle. The shallow water predominant in Jordan Creek generally does not permit use of the DH-48 at base-flow conditions. All samples, including blanks and duplicates, were acidified with H2SO4 in the field to less than pH 2 to stop all biological processes and preserve metal and nutrient concentrations, and then stored on ice in a cooler while in the field. In the lab all samples were stored in a refrigerator at 20º C until analyzed.",
  "WICR_BORCW": "Collection of water samples by Borchelt was accomplished by grab sampling as per 2006 Missouri State University Geomorphology Laboratory Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) W-1, Standard Operating Procedures for Water Sampling. A summary is as follows. Five hundred milliliter (mL) plastic sample bottles were cleaned before each sampling run with an acid wash of 2% diluted hydrochloric acid and properly labeled with the site name, date and sample type. Water samples were collected as grab samples at a wadeable depth at each stream site. Using this method, the sample bottle was rinsed three times in the stream to remove any cleaner or acid wash solution. The bottle was then inserted into the water at approximately 1/3 of the stream depth below the surface and orientated into the stream flow. Care was taken not to collect sediments that had been disturbed while wading into the stream. The sample bottle was held in the water until approximately 80% of the bottle was full and then quickly removed and capped. This prevented sediment and dissolved solids carried in the flow from accumulating in the bottle beyond what was present in the average unit of water. Sample bottles were acidified with sulfuric acid (H2SO4) to pH less than or equal to 2, and placed in a cooler above the ice (not submerged). Samples were stored in a refrigerator at MSU's Geomorphology Laboratory prior to analysis. More details can be found in Missouri State University Geomorphology Laboratory Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) W-1, for Water Sampling, in Appendix C of Borchelt 2007.",
  "WICR_GSBLF": "Base-flow water samples were collected by the U.S. Geological Survey at a cross section within the stream that could be waded. If there was sufficient depth, these samples were collected with a DH-81 hand-held isokinetic sampler constructed of Teflon using the equal-width increment method. Please see paper for more details. The sample was composited in a churn splitter (pre-cleaned polyethylene container) from which aliquots were drawn for processing before shipment to the laboratory. If there was insufficient depth (less than 0.5 feet) to use the DH-81, base-flow samples were collected at 5 equal width increments using a 2-liter (L) glass bottle and composited in a churn splitter. At all sites samples for the total ion chromatography (TIC) organic scan were collected in a 1-L amber glass bottle from the centroid of flow.

  "WICR_GSLTS": "The Semi-Permeable Membrane Devices (SPMDs) were used by the U.S. Geological Survey for long-term event sampling of organic constituents at the farthest downstream sampling points in the basin, Wilsons Creek near Battlefield. A SPMD is an artificial device designed to mimic the parts of animals that cause bioconcentration. It is a long, flat, plastic tube containing oil. The special plastic of the SPMD allows contaminants to pass through, like membranes of animal cells. The oil inside is similar to a highly purified fish fat. Often it is hard to detect the contaminants through normal chemical procedures because they are present at such low concentrations in the water. The SPMDs gather hydrophobic contaminants similar to a fish. The SPMDs are placed in the water and left for a period of time. The hydrophobic contaminants in the water pass through the plastic membrane and dissolve in the oil, parallel to the process in fish. After the SPMDs are retrieved from the environment they are chemically analyzed for the contaminants. The unique ability of the SPMD samplers to simulate the bioconcentration of organic compounds in aquatic biota enable the detection of a number of compounds that may not have been detectable by standard water analyses. The hydrophobic organic compounds are preferentially concentrated in the lipid material of the SPMD and can be detected on analysis of the dialysates. The presence of these compounds can affect the overall aquatic ecosystem health because many of them can be acutely toxic or genotoxic to aquatic biota. Aquatic biota living in the Wilsons Creek Basin are potentially bioaccumulating the same complex organic mixture as in the SPMDs. The harmful effects of long-term exposure of aquatic biota to the compounds present during base flow is compounded by the short-term exposure to the myriad of compounds present in stormwater runoff. Five SPMDs were placed in a clean stainless steel carrier and deployed in the stream. The long-term base-flow SPMD samples were left in the water for 30 or 31 days before being removed, packaged, and shipped to Environmental Sampling Technologies (EST) of St. Joseph, Missouri, for dialysis and cleanup. For SPMDs, the relation between the ambient water concentration of the constituent and the concentration of the constituent in the triolein-lipid of the SPMD is a first-order kinetics equation. Numerous rate constants and partition coefficients must be known to calculate ambient water concentration when the constituent is not at equilibrium with the triolein of the SPMD. Most of these parameters are not yet well known. At equilibrium, ambient water concentration can be calculated from the lipid-water partition coefficient (Klw) and the concentration of the constituent in the SPMD. For hydrophobic compounds, the Klw can be approximated by the octanol-water partition coefficient of the constituent (Kow). Unfortunately, the SPMDs probably were not given enough time to equilibrate (especially during storm events) with all of the compounds detected, and thus ambient water concentrations cannot be computed.",
  "WICR_GSSWF": "An attempt was made by the U.S. Geological Survey to collect samples of stormwater from all of the sites once during each season; however, because the study was conducted during an unusually dry year and because rainfall intensities and quantities vary greatly even over relatively short distances, it was nearly impossible to collect samples at every site during any particular storm event. As a result, the sampling period was divided into seasons during which samples were to be collected once at each site. Even then, because rainfall events often were too far apart or too close together, each site could not be sampled during each season. More than one storm usually was sampled during each season. However, samples were not collected from some sites for every season either because there was not enough runoff at the site to meet the minimum sampling requirements, or the rainfall events that did meet the requirements were missed. Because of the potential danger of wading in a rain-swollen stream, stormwater samples were collected from the bank as far out into the flow as practical. Samples obtained during storm events were collected in clean 2-L glass bottles and composited in a churn splitter. To ensure storm samples would be representative of the initial stormwater runoff, sites were sampled only after meeting specific requirements. Please see paper for more details. After the gage-height requirement was satisfied, sampling was initiated on the rising limb of the storm hydrograph, and samples were collected as follows: the first bottle was collected, 5 minutes later the second bottle was collected, 5 minutes later the third bottle was collected, 7 minutes later the fourth bottle was collected, and 10 minutes later the fifth bottle was collected. The 10 L of sample (five 2-L sub-samples) were composited and aliquots were drawn for processing before shipment to the laboratory. Gage height and physical properties values were recorded when the third sub-sample was collected. At all sites a 1-L amber glass bottle for the total ion chromatography (TIC) organic scan also was collected at the same time as the third sub-sample.

  "WICR_KORSB": "At each site, two random samples were collected on each date by Korsch. Samples were collected every three months in March, June, September, and December, over a two year period (1993-1994), for a total of eight dates. All collections were made during the day, between the hours of 10 a.m. and 5 p.m. Benthic macroinvertebrates were collected with a 46 by 20 cm rectangular aquatic kick net, mesh size 900 um, from a stream area of approximately one square meter. Each sample was pooled from separate collections in riffle and run habitats of the stream. Sampling involved thorough agitation of the substrate for one minute in the kick net area. Each pooled sample of macroinvertebrates was placed in a tray marked with a numbered grid, and 100 individuals picked at random, following procedures outlined in ?Rapid Bioassessment Protocols II and III?

  "WICR_MSTIN": "Missouri Stream Team macroinvertebrate sampling was implemented in various habitats by kick and D-frame nets according to the following procedure: Collect three net sets of invertebrates from three different microhabitats. This ensures a more complete picture of what lives in the stream and more accurately reflects stream health. Adequate sampling can be achieved by one person with a D-frame net, but two people may be needed for a kick net. If possible, take all three net sets from different areas within a stable riffle. Microhabitats to sample include differences in rock size, flow, leaf packs, and emergent vegetation. Always work in an upstream direction so that sampling activities do not disturb portions of the riffle to be sampled later. If there is not enough riffle habitat within the 300-foot sampling site, sample alternative microhabitats. Prioritize sampling of habitats as follows: riffle, root mat, snags, and lastly, non-flow. During the initial visit to the site, chose the microhabitats that will be sampled. For all subsequent sampling, the same microhabitats should be sampled to ensure the data collection will be consistent over time. Record the microhabitat(s) on the Macroinvertebrate Data Sheet. For sampling stream with riffles, sampling may require two people - one to hold the net and the other to dislodge invertebrates from the substrate. Place the net in the riffle facing upstream and tilt it to provide a pocket. Ensure the bottom of the net is on the stream bottom with no gaps between the net and substrate. This will prevent organisms from washing under the net. Rub all large stones in a 3-foot by 3-foot area immediately upstream of the net to dislodge invertebrates and wash them into the net. The following is the collection procedure according to the Stream Team Training Notebook: Dance and kick within the 3-foot by 3-foot area to disturb all of the substrate 3 to 6 inches deep to dislodge the invertebrates into the net. To sample streams without riffles or with riffles too small for three net sets, collect from root mats with a kick net. This will require two people. Have one person place the side of the kick net against the bank on the downstream side of the root mat. Make sure the net is anchored to the stream bed. The other person will then kick the root mat in a swirling motion with one foot to create a circular current in order to dislodge the invertebrates from the root mat. The circular motion of the sampler's foot will drive the invertebrates into the net even if there is no current. Sample collection from snags requires two people. Have one person hold the net in a horizontal position about 6 to 12 inches under the water. The second person will remove the snag from the water by pulling the snag out of the water quickly. If the snag is removed too slowly, the invertebrates may swim away. Hold the snag above the net. Brush the snag downwards with a brush to dislodge the invertebrates. Sample approximately 3 to 5 snags for one net set. Sample non-flow areas in the same manner as a riffle, collecting three separate samples. However, the sampler will need to use a swirling motion with the foot to create a current to move debris into the net. Although this habitat can be sampled using a kick net, it is easier with a D-frame net.",

  "WICR_OULOB": "The Ozark Underground Laboratory (OUL) used the following technique to sample for optical brighteners, summarized from Aley and Thomson's 1984 paper entitled, 'Septic Fields and the Protection of Groundwater Quality in Greene County, Missouri.' Optical brighteners are intensely fluorescent white dyes. They are used to whiten cloth and paper products. In the soap and detergent industry they are added to laundry soap to make clothes whiter-than-white after washing. The optical brighteners actually dye clothes white; as a result the consumer gets a whiter laundry than would be possible with just the removal of dirt. The only source of unadsorbed optical brighteners in the study area is laundry soap and detergents. Essentially all laundry waters are discharged to septic fields or sanitary sewers; therefore, the recovery of optical brighteners from springs can be accepted as proof of water contamination by sewage. The presence of detectable quantities of optical brighteners in springs is evidence of septic system failures to groundwater systems. The OUL optical brighteners sampling method uses samplers of specially-prepared cotton, free of optical brighteners. The samplers are placed in the flow of a spring and if optical brighteners are present, they will be adsorbed onto the cotton fibers. After being placed in a spring for 6-26 days, the samplers are collected and placed in labeled Whirlpak® plastic bags to prevent contamination and drying. They are refrigerated to prevent molding prior to cleaning and analysis. Cleaning requires thorough and prolonged washing with pulsating jets of high-pressure water, free of optical brighteners and chlorine residual (chlorine oxidizes and destroys optical brighteners). Cleaning removes dirt and organics which mask the fluorescence of optical brighteners. After cleaning the samplers are returned to new Whirlpak® bags and subjected to long-wave ultraviolet light in a dark lab. A negative sample (no optical brighteners present) is consulted for comparison. The four result categories are: Strongly Positive (SR) ? the sample cotton is entirely white and the color is brilliantly white; Moderate Positive (MP) - the sample cotton is entirely white or nearly entirely white and the color is not brilliantly white; Weakly Positive (WP) ? less than 75% of the sample cotton has been whitened and optical brighteners are visibly present but the color is not brilliantly white; Negative (None Detected; ND) - Optical brighteners are either not detectable or are absent. At least two samplers were placed at each spring in the event of damage or loss. Each spring was sampled for two periods. Commonly the results were the same for both sampling periods. When the results at a particular spring were different for the two periods, the samplers were re-examined (all samplers were saved and frozen for re-examination if needed). A determination was made to best characterize the result.",
