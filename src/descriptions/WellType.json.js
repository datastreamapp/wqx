  Anode:
    'A anode is the main component of a cathodic protection (CP) system used to protect buried or submerged metal structures from corrosion.\nAnode materials: there are three main metals used as galvanic anodes, magnesium, aluminum and zinc.',
  Capture: '',
  Commercial: 'Commercial water supply well',
  Dewater:
    'Dewatering is the removal of water from solid material or soil by wet classification, centrifugation, filtration, or similar solid-liquid separation processes, such as removal of residual liquid from a filter cake by a filter press as part of various industrial processes.\nConstruction dewatering, unwatering, or water control are common terms used to describe removal or draining groundwater or surface water from a riverbed, construction site, caisson, or mine shaft, by pumping or evaporation. ',
  Domestic: 'Domestic water supply well',
  Drainage:
    'Storm water drainage wells are Class V underground injection control (UIC) wells used to remove storm water or urban runoff from impervious surfaces such as roadways, roofs, and paved surfaces to prevent flooding, infiltration into basements, etc. The primary types of storm water drainage wells are bored wells, dug wells, and improved sinkholes.',
  Geothermal:
    'A geothermal heat pump or ground source heat pump (GSHP) is a central heating and/or cooling system that transfers heat to or from the ground.\r\nIt uses the earth as a heat source (in the winter) or a heat sink (in the summer). This design takes advantage of the moderate temperatures in the ground to boost efficiency and reduce the operational costs of heating and cooling systems, and may be combined with solar heating to form a geosolar system with even greater efficiency.',
  'Heat Reservoir': '',
  Industrial: 'Industrial water supply well',
  Injection:
    'An injection well is used to place fluid underground into porous geologic formations. These underground formations may range from deep sandstone or limestone, to a shallow soil layer. Injected fluids may include water, wastewater, brine (salt water), or water mixed with chemicals.',
  Irrigation:
    'Irrigation wells and systems are built for a variety of reasons, ranging from assisting the performance of various places. These places range from a garden center, to a greenhouse, to a farm, to anywhere that efficient plant growth is desired.',
  Monitoring:
    'The term "monitoring well" is limited to wells designed to monitor subsurface water in the saturated zone, existing at or above atmospheric pressure (groundwater); rather than water, water vapor, and/or gases contained in the unsaturated or vadose zone.',
  Observation:
    'The action or process of observing something or someone carefully or in order to gain information',
  'Oil/Gas Production': '',
  Other: '',
  Piezometer:
    'An instrument for measuring the pressure of a liquid or gas, or something related to pressure (such as the compressibility of liquid). ',
  Recharge:
    'Water added to the aquifer through the unsaturated zone after infiltration and percolation following any storm rainfall event.',
  Remediation:
    'The action of remedying something, in particular of reversing or stopping environmental damage.',
  Repressurization: 'The process or act of pressurizing',
  Seismic:
    'Relating to or denoting geological surveying methods involving vibrations produced artificially by explosions.',
  'Soil Vapor Extraction':
    'A physical treatment process for in situ remediation of volatile contaminants in vadose zone (unsaturated) soils (EPA, 2012).',
  'Soil Vapor Monitoring':
    'Detection and monitoring of volatile organic compounds (VOCs).',
  'Test Hole':
    'A drill hole or shallow excavation to assess an ore body or to obtain rock samples to determine their structural and physical characteristics.',
  'Waste Disposal':
    'Removing and destroying or storing damaged, used or other unwanted domestic, agricultural or industrial products and substances. Disposal includes burning, burial at landfill sites or at sea, and recycling.',
